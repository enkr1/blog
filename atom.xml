    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2><p>this week felt slow on purpose—i let time pass and just thought aboutthe future. i officially started two modules this sem: TCX1101 &amp;TCX2002. re-learning maths instantly pulled me back to secondaryschool.</p><p>reminiscing...</p><p>i used to be that kid in class—naughty, restless, not listening. askme why? no idea.</p><p>then, out of nowhere, something clicked...</p><p>about three months before form 3—the big exam that decides yourstream (science, accountancy, architecture etc.)—i suddenly realised howimportant knowledge is. i crammed. no seconds wasted. boom: accountancystream (class 2). first exam, additional maths 97. that's when i got toknow folks from the top science class—super friendly, super humble—westudied together. i helped where i could; maths was my strongest, myfavourite.</p><p>this week, all those feelings came back—the stress, the nerves, thelost-ness... and the quiet stubbornness to keep going anyway.</p><p>looking back, i'm sooo proud—but NOT satisfied.不是贪心，是有底气的饥饿感。i know there's more in me.</p><p>something better is coming. i’m building toward the next next NEXTlevel. 🔥</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>this week's reading all pointed to the same reminder: don't rush.slow down, think, then move.</p><p>in 《段位》, a few chapters emphasise 先想后动—think before you makea move; think more to avoid avoidable errors. couldn't agree more.</p><p>and this line from Jewish Wisdom for Business Success hit mehard:</p><blockquote><p>“When the going gets tough, realise that fear makes threats looklarger than they really are and there is no need to retreat to what isfamiliar. remember the strength you had to leave the past and moveforward with faith.”</p></blockquote><p>right now, i'm in a good position to aim for the right role—not justthe next role—and even leave space to build something of my own. norushing, no panic moves. this decision is pivotal, so i'll choose withintention.</p><p>how i'm applying it next week:</p><ul><li>block thinking time before big decisions (no "instant yes").</li><li>write a one-pager for any major move: goals, trade-offs, risks, nextsteps.</li><li>default to "not yet" on shiny distractions for 48 hours.</li><li>measure twice, cut once: review plans and code beforeexecution.</li></ul><p>slow is smooth; smooth is fast.</p><hr /><p>some other insights from <strong>Jewish Wisdom</strong>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>INSIGHT FOR BUSINESS</strong>: Fear makes the unknown seemmore ominous than it really is. Sticking with strategies of the past canoften hurt a business. The world is always changing-manage for today andtomorrow instead of yesterday.</p><p><strong>INSIGHT FOR LIFE</strong>: Always face the future, not thepast. You need no longer fear the enemies that you have alreadyconquered.</p></blockquote><h2 id="memories-august-4---10">🥰 Memories | August 4 - 10</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7206.jpeg" class="" title="lunchie w sis!"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7207.jpeg" class="" title="topped up my hair spray"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7209.jpeg" class="" title="交流时，需保持冷静思考 - 这本书真的，好深，好喜欢"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7210.jpeg" class="" title="anthropic droppin fire"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7211.jpeg" class="" title="12 golden rules for low latency?"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7212.jpeg" class="" title="懂得给对方台阶下也是一门学问"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7218.jpeg" class="" title="捧杀"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7219.jpeg" class="" title="捧杀 - 用头脑去思考的重要性"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7220.jpeg" class="" title="tried 了一下..."><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7221.jpeg" class="" title="thank you, next..."><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7222.jpeg" class="" title="日常"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7227.jpeg" class="" title="认真思考了，PT 之路开始。"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7237.jpeg" class="" title="我真的 🥹"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7239.jpeg" class="" title="来了这家！有些应该忘记的回忆，突然涌上..."><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7240.jpeg" class="" title="oh my 天, 14 bucks for..."><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7241.jpeg" class="" title="chat is that worth 14 bucks chat?"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7243.jpeg" class="" title="just say no - learning negotiation... cuz they be funny lately"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7244.jpeg" class="" title="ask for more information - yes, guys, ... pls"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7245.jpeg" class="" title="give concessionary info"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7247.jpg" class="" title="compliment from 🐽🐽"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7255.jpeg" class="" title="look at the cloud guys ☁️"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7257.jpeg" class="" title="牛肉小面！真的很小，吃不饱，，，但是好吃！"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_B661CE09-A53E-42FC-8620-B55D752F6B3A.JPEG" class="" title="配上 avocado + banana"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7259.jpeg" class="" title="study room back view"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7263.jpeg" class="" title="知人者智，想得越多，错的越少"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7264.jpeg" class="" title="鸡饭，一盘"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7265.jpeg" class="" title="鸡蛋，四颗"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7266.jpeg" class="" title="如果你看到前面的阴影，别怕！那是因为你的背后有阳光！- awwww"><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7267.jpeg" class="" title="when the going gets tough, realise that the fear makes threats look larger than they really are."><img data-src="/journal-week-40/IMG_7268.jpeg" class="" title="Always face the future, not the past.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2><p>this week, i dedicated most of my time to planning and prepping forschool— i built a comprehensive notion database to "project manage"myself like a proper semester sprint 😆</p><p>also did a massive revamp of my old notion setups—it felt like aproper 大扫除! 😮‍💨</p><p>the cleanup gave me a better grasp of my course roadmap, moduleselection, and timetable structure.</p><p>i basically used all my workers (4o, o3, deepseek, kimi, doubao,claude, qwen) to help analyse my module content and get a clearer senseof which electives to prioritise.</p><p>oh—and i also imported my class timetable to my google calendar withNUS label (used 4o)! now, my school schedule is fully synced to mycalendar, with important emails redirected to my personal inbox +labelled. everything in one place 🥰</p><p>another small win—i confirmed my advanced placement credits and got40U granted!</p><p>which means... i only need 80U to graduate!!! 🎓</p><p>and guess what—i just started studying TXC1101, my first module.</p><p>so excited to keep this momentum going.</p><p>keep showing up, keep doing good. 💪</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>one key insight this week was about how we utilise our connections inlife—not just network, but nurture them.</p><p>i've always been someone with a "thick face"-i constantly ask forfeedback, seek honest advice, and maybe i've annoyed a few people in theprocess.. i guess? 🧐</p><p>but what i've come to realise is... asking for feedback is not justabout improving myself.</p><p>it's also about building trust.</p><p>when people see you seriously applying their advice, they become yourinvisible coaches—they cheer for you without even realising it. as ChrisVoss once said, "when someone tries to coach you, and you let them, theybecome emotionally invested in your success."</p><p>this hit home especially after reading 《段位》Rank—once your mentorsrecognise your determination, your desire to grow, and your goals,they'll help you. they'll think of you first when the next opportunitycomes.</p><p>this week reminded me:</p><blockquote><p><em>Asking isn't weakness. it's a sign of strength—because you're notjust learning, you're co-creating your growth.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="memories-july-28---august-3">🥰 Memories | July 28 - August3</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7086.jpeg" class="" title="reading 《段位》"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7087.jpeg" class="" title="觉得这个挺有意思的，其实不经意的也有在默默使用，还得继续磨炼！"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7093.jpeg" class="" title="wc 我真的觉得这家蛮好吃的"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7094.jpeg" class="" title="鸡丝小面！确实很小 好吃，就是吃不饱"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7102.jpeg" class="" title="GYM!"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7103.jpeg" class="" title="已经在考虑了"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7115.jpeg" class="" title="having a NUS grad dinner with desmond yong &amp; darren, hahahaah and they are my seniors now"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7117.jpeg" class="" title="not bad, the soup really hits - forgot to take pics"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7118.jpeg" class="" title="and i- yes i drank... a BEERRRR, dAMN ik... after like ages fr"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7120.jpeg" class="" title="🫡"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7190.jpeg" class="" title="now i tried to take ss whenever i saw sth insightful instead of saving them over linkedin, so i get a chance to talk about it here while journalling or whenever im cleaning up my photos"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7191.jpeg" class=""><hr /><blockquote><p>wow, after 2 weeks of consistently journalling, i realised howimportant it is to journal. not just for the sack of writing thingsdown, but for what happens in the process-when you write, you recallmoments, you reminisce on the little things, reflect on your actions,and learn from every mistake you've made. i really love this process ofslowing down, analysing, and understanding myself a little better eachtime. feels like i'm growing, one entry at a time. 🌱</p></blockquote>]]></content>

<strong>never fear theunknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>wai chun</strong>—my senior, my day-one mentor, stillguiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a questionabout ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wroteme an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carryfrom him? <strong>patience, generosity, and the power of sharingknowledge selflessly.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>kenny chan</strong>—the people person. the one with allthe soft skills i've always admired. presentation, people, sales—he cantalk to literally anyone and make them feel at ease. calm, steady,composed. what i carry from him? <strong>the importance of presence—howyou show up, how you connect with others.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>ze hung</strong>—new blood when i was about to leavepixium, but man, did he leave an impression. solo-ing flutter projects,carrying them on his back, and never afraid to stand up for what hebelieves. he challenged requirements, asked the hard questions. what icarry from him? <strong>courage—to question, to stand my ground, to notjust accept but understand.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>médéric</strong>—CSO, security pro, the one who taught mereact, next.js, vim, bash, scripting, devops, aws, terraform, how todeploy php yii2 apps, how to talk to clients. had my first client lunchwith him. and outside work? party animal! 🤣 he broke every techstereotype i had. what i carry from him? <strong>balance. be sharp inyour craft, but never forget to live.</strong></p></li></ul><p>🌱 these people built pieces of my foundation. their lessons are inme, every day.</p><h2 id="memories-april-7-13">🥰 Memories | April 7 ~ 13</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5076.jpeg" class="" title="breakfasttttt"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5077.jpeg" class="" title="lunchie"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5079.jpeg" class="" title="been trying so hard to fix my sleep schedule..."><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5080.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5081.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5082.jpeg" class="" title="dabao-ed dinner before continueing my work"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5085.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5088.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5089.jpeg" class="" title="espresso at Volks"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5090.jpeg" class="" title="dinner"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5093.jpeg" class="" title="thank you for those who read my blog from the states, china, sg &amp; other 🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5094.jpeg" class="" title="ma bro is risin too"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5096.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5099.jpeg" class="" title="pixie lunch at 东方美食！必吃「蒜泥白肉」！！！！"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5100.jpeg" class="" title="拉皮"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5101.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5104.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5105.jpeg" class="" title="🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5109.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5110.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5111.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5112.jpeg" class="" title="friday night 🔚"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5116.jpeg" class="" title="iykyk no need more words &lt;3"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5117.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5137.jpeg" class="">]]></content>

full reset, i feel brand new again. i took almost three weeksto really recover, reflect, and rebuild. but damn, i'm so proud ofmyself for allowing that space to slow down and go deep. 🥺</p><p>honestly, i'm glad this happened. it was the push i needed to stepout of my comfort zone and get back on the route that aligns with who itruly want to become. deep down, i've always known i'm going to besuccessful—but how could i ever get there without going through thesedowns?</p><p>all part of the plan.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>You can't control the wind but you can adjust yoursail.</em></strong> it's not about what happens to you, it's how youreact. <ahref="https://youtube.com/shorts/D8r460AQJk4?si=viE7vfAqGdLVifU9">Source</a></p></blockquote><p>i just need to react calmly, move with intention, and make the rightdecisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i knowthese small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for astronger, wiser me.</p><p>and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesdaymorning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably stillhalf-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the airwhile walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgetscuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit theground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹</p><p>on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg!even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. timewith family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me howthankful i am for 节日 like this as a chinese malaysian. it's somethingyou can't quite explain, but it just feels right. ❤️</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>recently, i haven't been reading books on my ipad during my morningcommute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myselftalking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts,deep questions, even things i'm just suddenly curious about. i guessi've always been that curious kid who loves thinking, wondering,questioning.</p><p>honestly, tools like gpt have helped me a lot these past few years.it's like having a thinking partner that's always down to explorewhatever's on my mind. and sometimes, that's exactly what i need tostart my day right. ☀️🧠</p><h2
