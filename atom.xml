<strong>never fear theunknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>wai chun</strong>—my senior, my day-one mentor, stillguiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a questionabout ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wroteme an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carryfrom him?

full reset, i feel brand new again. i took almost three weeksto really recover, reflect, and rebuild. but damn, i'm so proud ofmyself for allowing that space to slow down and go deep. 🥺</p><p>honestly, i'm glad this happened. it was the push i needed to stepout of my comfort zone and get back on the route that aligns with who itruly want to become. deep down, i've always known i'm going to besuccessful—but how could i ever get there without going through thesedowns?</p><p>all part of the plan.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>You can't control the wind but you can adjust yoursail.</em></strong> it's not about what happens to you, it's how youreact. <ahref="https://youtube.com/shorts/D8r460AQJk4?si=viE7vfAqGdLVifU9">Source</a></p></blockquote><p>i just need to react calmly, move with intention, and make the rightdecisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i knowthese small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for astronger, wiser me.</p><p>and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesdaymorning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably stillhalf-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the airwhile walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgetscuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit theground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹</p><p>on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg!even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. timewith family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me howthankful i am for 节日 like this as a chinese malaysian. it's somethingyou can't quite explain, but it just feels right. ❤️</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>recently, i haven't been reading books on my ipad during my morningcommute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myselftalking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts,deep questions, even things i'm just suddenly curious about. i guessi've always been that curious kid who loves thinking, wondering,questioning.</p><p>honestly, tools like gpt have helped me a lot these past few years.it's like having a thinking partner that's always down to explorewhatever's on my mind. and sometimes, that's exactly what i need tostart my day right. ☀️🧠</p><h2
