    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2><p>this week, i dedicated most of my time to planning and prepping forschool— i built a comprehensive notion database to "project manage"myself like a proper semester sprint 😆</p><p>also did a massive revamp of my old notion setups—it felt like aproper 大扫除! 😮‍💨</p><p>the cleanup gave me a better grasp of my course roadmap, moduleselection, and timetable structure.</p><p>i basically used all my workers (4o, o3, deepseek, kimi, doubao,claude, qwen) to help analyse my module content and get a clearer senseof which electives to prioritise.</p><p>oh—and i also imported my class timetable to my google calendar withNUS label (used 4o)! now, my school schedule is fully synced to mycalendar, with important emails redirected to my personal inbox +labelled. everything in one place 🥰</p><p>another small win—i confirmed my advanced placement credits and got40U granted!</p><p>which means... i only need 80U to graduate!!! 🎓</p><p>and guess what—i just started studying TXC1101, my first module.</p><p>so excited to keep this momentum going.</p><p>keep showing up, keep doing good. 💪</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>one key insight this week was about how we utilise our connections inlife—not just network, but nurture them.</p><p>i've always been someone with a "thick face"-i constantly ask forfeedback, seek honest advice, and maybe i've annoyed a few people in theprocess.. i guess? 🧐</p><p>but what i've come to realise is... asking for feedback is not justabout improving myself.</p><p>it's also about building trust.</p><p>when people see you seriously applying their advice, they become yourinvisible coaches—they cheer for you without even realising it. as ChrisVoss once said, "when someone tries to coach you, and you let them, theybecome emotionally invested in your success."</p><p>this hit home especially after reading 《段位》Rank—once your mentorsrecognise your determination, your desire to grow, and your goals,they'll help you. they'll think of you first when the next opportunitycomes.</p><p>this week reminded me:</p><blockquote><p><em>Asking isn't weakness. it's a sign of strength—because you're notjust learning, you're co-creating your growth.</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="memories-july-28---may-3">🥰 Memories | July 28 - May 3</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7086.jpeg" class="" title="reading 《段位》"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7087.jpeg" class="" title="觉得这个挺有意思的，其实不经意的也有在默默使用，还得继续磨炼！"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7093.jpeg" class="" title="wc 我真的觉得这家蛮好吃的"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7094.jpeg" class="" title="鸡丝小面！确实很小 好吃，就是吃不饱"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7102.jpeg" class="" title="GYM!"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7103.jpeg" class="" title="已经在考虑了"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7115.jpeg" class="" title="having a NUS grad dinner with desmond yong &amp; darren, hahahaah and they are my seniors now"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7117.jpeg" class="" title="not bad, the soup really hits - forgot to take pics"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7118.jpeg" class="" title="and i- yes i drank... a BEERRRR, dAMN ik... after like ages fr"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7120.jpeg" class="" title="🫡"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7190.jpeg" class="" title="now i tried to take ss whenever i saw sth insightful instead of saving them over linkedin, so i get a chance to talk about it here while journalling or whenever im cleaning up my photos"><img data-src="/journal-week-39/IMG_7191.jpeg" class=""><hr /><blockquote><p>wow, after 2 weeks of consistently journalling, i realised howimportant it is to journal. not just for the sack of writing thingsdown, but for what happens in the process-when you write, you recallmoments, you reminisce on the little things, reflect on your actions,and learn from every mistake you've made. i really love this process ofslowing down, analysing, and understanding myself a little better eachtime. feels like i'm growing, one entry at a time. 🌱</p></blockquote>]]></content>

<strong>never fear theunknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>wai chun</strong>—my senior, my day-one mentor, stillguiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a questionabout ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wroteme an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carryfrom him? <strong>patience, generosity, and the power of sharingknowledge selflessly.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>kenny chan</strong>—the people person. the one with allthe soft skills i've always admired. presentation, people, sales—he cantalk to literally anyone and make them feel at ease. calm, steady,composed. what i carry from him? <strong>the importance of presence—howyou show up, how you connect with others.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>ze hung</strong>—new blood when i was about to leavepixium, but man, did he leave an impression. solo-ing flutter projects,carrying them on his back, and never afraid to stand up for what hebelieves. he challenged requirements, asked the hard questions. what icarry from him? <strong>courage—to question, to stand my ground, to notjust accept but understand.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>médéric</strong>—CSO, security pro, the one who taught mereact, next.js, vim, bash, scripting, devops, aws, terraform, how todeploy php yii2 apps, how to talk to clients. had my first client lunchwith him. and outside work? party animal! 🤣 he broke every techstereotype i had. what i carry from him? <strong>balance. be sharp inyour craft, but never forget to live.</strong></p></li></ul><p>🌱 these people built pieces of my foundation. their lessons are inme, every day.</p><h2 id="memories-april-7-13">🥰 Memories | April 7 ~ 13</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5076.jpeg" class="" title="breakfasttttt"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5077.jpeg" class="" title="lunchie"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5079.jpeg" class="" title="been trying so hard to fix my sleep schedule..."><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5080.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5081.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5082.jpeg" class="" title="dabao-ed dinner before continueing my work"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5085.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5088.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5089.jpeg" class="" title="espresso at Volks"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5090.jpeg" class="" title="dinner"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5093.jpeg" class="" title="thank you for those who read my blog from the states, china, sg &amp; other 🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5094.jpeg" class="" title="ma bro is risin too"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5096.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5099.jpeg" class="" title="pixie lunch at 东方美食！必吃「蒜泥白肉」！！！！"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5100.jpeg" class="" title="拉皮"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5101.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5104.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5105.jpeg" class="" title="🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5109.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5110.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5111.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5112.jpeg" class="" title="friday night 🔚"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5116.jpeg" class="" title="iykyk no need more words &lt;3"><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5117.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5137.jpeg" class="">]]></content>

calmly, move with intention, and make the rightdecisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i knowthese small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for astronger, wiser me.</p><p>and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesdaymorning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably stillhalf-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the airwhile walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgetscuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit theground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹</p><p>on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg!even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. timewith family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me

been reading books on my ipad during my morningcommute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myselftalking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts,deep
