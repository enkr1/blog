    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2><p>this week, i conquered one of my biggest interview traumas.</p><p>back in 2023, i interviewed with a company that completely caught meoff guard. there was a question that shut me down entirely—i froze. nofollow-up questions, no attempts to clarify. just silence. i was so deepin self-doubt that all i could do was sit in that fear. 😞</p><p>but after that interview, i made a promise to myself. i dove deepinto that specific topic. i studied it until i truly understood it—notjust to memorise it, but to recognise the underlying pattern. i didn'twant to be caught off guard again.</p><p>fast forward two years, and guess what? i got another shot. i had thechance to interview with them again.</p><p>this time, i clarified inputs, rephrased questions, walked through mythinking process, offered multiple approaches, did a mini speedrun tovalidate the logic, and coded the full solution. not only did i staycalm, but i actually enjoyed the whole process.</p><p>what i've come to realise is—yes, AI will probably replace a lot ofcoding. but what makes coding fun isn't just the code. it's that 0-to-1moment—the "ah ha!" breakthrough, the joy of unravelling a complexpuzzle. it's the ability to notice new patterns every time, and thatfeeling... that is what i fell in love with again this week. ❤️‍🔥</p><p>another bittersweet highlight was kaiqing's departure. 🥺</p><p>it came as a surprise, but i'm glad we got the chance to connect morebefore he left. we talked more over tea time, shared pantry convos inthe morning and late afternoon, and finally built a bond i wishedstarted earlier.</p><p>i genuinely wish him the very best, and who knows—maybe our pathswill cross again someday. 🫡</p><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5253.jpeg" class="large"><h2 id="memories-april-21-27">🥰 Memories | April 21 ~ 27</h2><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5210.jpeg" class="" title="lunchie"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5211.jpeg" class="" title="久违的重聚 with Peter Lu~ 我们忘记拍照啦"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5212.jpeg" class="" title="durian mochi!"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5216.jpeg" class="" title="breakie"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5218.jpeg" class="" title="lunchhh"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5223.jpeg" class="" title="foolai gave us this from his japan trip &lt;3"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5225.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5226.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5233.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5235.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5237.jpeg" class="" title="ST Engineering visiting!"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5238.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5240.jpeg" class="" title="in-person interview hits different."><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5242.jpeg" class="" title="sunset always shows up whenever i need her 🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5245.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5250.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5257.jpeg" class="" title="🥺"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5262.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5265.jpeg" class="" title="yes"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5268.jpeg" class="" title="F29 is the place to get some good snacks"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5269.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5270.jpeg" class=""><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5272.jpeg" class="" title="yes - same thing"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5274.jpeg" class="" title="and these half boiled eggs!"><img data-src="/journal-week-35/IMG_5273.jpeg" class="" title="im a koala 🐨">]]></content>

<strong>never fear theunknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>wai chun</strong>—my senior, my day-one mentor, stillguiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a questionabout ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wroteme an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carryfrom him? <strong>patience, generosity, and the power of sharingknowledge selflessly.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>kenny chan</strong>—the people person. the one with allthe soft skills i've always admired. presentation, people, sales—he cantalk to literally anyone and make them feel at ease. calm, steady,composed. what i carry from him? <strong>the importance of presence—howyou show up, how you connect with others.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>ze hung</strong>—new blood when i was about to leavepixium, but man, did he leave an impression. solo-ing flutter projects,carrying them on his back, and never afraid to stand up for what hebelieves. he challenged requirements, asked the hard questions. what icarry from him? <strong>courage—to question, to stand my ground, to notjust accept but understand.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>médéric</strong>—CSO, security pro, the one who taught mereact, next.js, vim, bash, scripting, devops, aws, terraform, how todeploy php yii2 apps, how to talk to clients. had my first client lunchwith him. and outside work?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2><p>heehee writing this journal on my way back to jb, and my mac only has7% battery left 🥰</p><p>after a full reset, i feel brand new again. i took almost three weeksto really recover, reflect, and rebuild. but damn, i'm so proud ofmyself for allowing that space to slow down and go deep. 🥺</p><p>honestly, i'm glad this happened. it was the push i needed to stepout of my comfort zone and get back on the route that aligns with who itruly want to become. deep down, i've always known i'm going to besuccessful—but how could i ever get there without going through thesedowns?</p><p>all part of the plan.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>You can't control the wind but you can adjust yoursail.</em></strong> it's not about what happens to you, it's how youreact. <ahref="https://youtube.com/shorts/D8r460AQJk4?si=viE7vfAqGdLVifU9">Source</a></p></blockquote><p>i just need to react calmly, move with intention, and make the rightdecisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i knowthese small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for astronger, wiser me.</p><p>and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesdaymorning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably stillhalf-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the airwhile walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgetscuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit theground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹</p><p>on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg!even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. timewith family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me howthankful i am for 节日 like this as a chinese malaysian. it's somethingyou can't quite explain, but it just feels right. ❤️</p><h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2><p>recently, i haven't been reading books on my ipad during my morningcommute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myselftalking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts,deep questions, even things i'm just suddenly curious about. i guessi've always been that curious kid who loves thinking, wondering,questioning.</p><p>honestly, tools like gpt have helped me a lot these past few years.it's like having a thinking partner that's always down to explorewhatever's on my mind. and sometimes, that's exactly what i need tostart my day right. ☀️🧠</p><h2
