&lt;p&gt;omg. this might just be one of the most embarrassing moments ever.
💀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for confidentiality reasons, i&#39;ll keep some details vague, but
basically... i bumped into a team leader who isn&#39;t based in sg and was
actually supposed to be &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; leader. and guess what? i
&lt;em&gt;didn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; recognise him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he greeted me first, full of energy and warmth, “hey, 竞辉,
你好你好！” and silly me? i just went, &lt;strong&gt;“哈咯哈咯 额
你是...?”&lt;/strong&gt; 💀💀💀 and he paused for half a sec, then went, “我是
XX” and me? full delayed reaction mode-“哦！！...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O.M.G. bRO. wth. idek why... hELPs...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in hindsight&lt;/strong&gt;, i &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; should&#39;ve handled it
better—at the very least, i could&#39;ve started with a better greeting,
asked how long he was in town for, or just engaged more naturally
instead of freezing like a deer in headlights. this was a &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt;
lesson for me, and trust me, i &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; let this happen
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;besides that little social disaster, feb wrapped up on a high note. i
managed to finish everything i planned for the month, and i also had an
amazing lunch with a &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;—such a perfect way to close the
week. 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;outside of work, i continued my pt sessions with my bro, and i could
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; see his progress. he&#39;s been sticking to the plan i set
up for him, sometimes? LOL, and ngl, that made me kinda happy. 🥺 it
reminded me of when i first started gyming—how much people like marcus
ong &amp;amp; genix guided me and helped me grow. i wouldn&#39;t be where i am
today without them, and now, being able to pass that knowledge down to
someone else? that&#39;s a full-circle moment right there bois. 💪🏼🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;还有一个 highlight， 就是 vicuz——我以前在马来西亚认识的很好的 beatbox
朋友之一！从 Armageddon 2019 到 TCBB 2019，他就是 msia beatbox
界的谐星，每次上场都是搞笑节目哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;那天，我就突然想说在我 ig 也分享一下我的
blog，反正也没差，就随缘，谁要看就看。结果，好久没联系的 vicuz
突然发了我的几句话：&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/journal-week-28/IMG_3318.jpg&quot; class=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🥹🥹🥹 我真的 wow，没想到居然有人会喜欢我写的 blog。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;突如其来的鼓励，很奇妙，也很感动。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;我想，本来就没有放弃的念头，现在更加坚定了，我要继续坚持写下去！📝&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;highlights-of-the-week&quot;&gt;Highlights of the Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another hectic week, but honestly, one of the most productive ones in
a while! i really felt like i was in the zone—managed to squeeze in a
lot of things and complete everything i had planned. ☺️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;aside from work, i finally set aside a night to discuss our upcoming
phuket trip in march with vinoth &amp;amp; yousheng! it&#39;s always exciting to
have something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;also! i gave my bro a comprehensive leg day breakdown!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he&#39;s currently in spain for his degree, so we had to do it over a
video call, which was a completely different experience compared to my
previous sharing session with toby, where we did it in person.
explaining movements virtually made me realise how important it is to be
concise and clear—i had to be extra mindful of my words to ensure my
explanations made sense without demonstrating in real time. i found this
challenge really interesting and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being a personal trainer has always been something i&#39;m passionate
about. not because i want to make it a career, but because i love
sharing my knowledge and experience with others—helping them avoid the
same mistakes i made, guiding them towards better progress, and seeing
them grow in their own journey. witnessing someone improve because of
something i taught them? that&#39;s one of the best feelings ever. 🥹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it also reinforces my own understanding of fitness. as Steve Bartlett
mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need
to be able to teach it to others. i can really see the truth in that
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it also deepens my own understanding of fitness. as Steven Bartlett
mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need
to be able to teach it to others. this concept has always been in me,
but experiencing it firsthand through coaching hits differently—it&#39;s a
reminder that teaching doesn&#39;t just help others grow, &quot;when one person
is teaching, two people learn&quot;, it solidifies my own knowledge too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-insights&quot;&gt;Reading Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this week, i revisited chapter 5 of Never Split the
Difference—&quot;Triggering the Two Words That Immediately Transform Any
Negotiation.&quot; i&#39;ve been actively trying to apply the paraphrasing +
labeling technique to summarise conversations better. the idea is to not
just restate what was said but also acknowledge the emotions behind
it—this makes the other person feel truly heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s definitely not an easy skill to master, but i can see myself
improving. learning how to communicate effectively has been one of my
biggest goals this year, and this small tweak in how i summarise
conversations is already making a difference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;上星期多亏天擎帮我抢到位置，终于参加了 2025 ByteDance
All-Hands！这次的关键词 “&lt;strong&gt;务实浪漫&lt;/strong&gt;”
乍听之下有点矛盾，但仔细想想，其实很有道理——&lt;strong&gt;踏踏实实地把事情做好，同时用浪漫的心态去面对自己的工作。浪漫的意思，不是花哨的幻想，而是能够在完成事情的过程中感受到快乐，并且享受这个过程。&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;换句话说，务实是脚踏实地地做好每一件事，而浪漫，则是全心全意地投入，真正沉浸在自己创造的价值里。当你被需要时，你始终在场，并且能稳定地输出。这种状态，本身就很浪漫。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;作为团队里的一份子，我一直希望能挑战更高的目标，不断突破自己，同时也从每一次经历中汲取经验，享受成长的过程。希望有一天，我能够成为更好的自己，为团队、为公司，带来更大的价值。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/journal-week-26/IMG_2973.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;large&quot; title=&quot;与梁汝波合照啦~ 📸&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;looking ahead, i&#39;ve been thinking a lot about long-term goals. i love
what i do now and the growth that comes with it, but one day, i hope to
take what i&#39;ve learned and build something of my own—a business, a
product, a team, a community. to get there, i need to deepen my
understanding of what people truly need and learn how to provide real
value. there&#39;s still so much more to explore, to learn, and i&#39;m excited
to keep learning every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on a side note, time management has been a challenge lately. i often
feel like there&#39;s never enough time in the day, constantly juggling
priorities while navigating unexpected tasks. i want to get better at
balancing execution with strategic thinking—knowing when to say no, when
to delegate, and how to optimise my workflow so i can be more effective
under tight deadlines, sudden ops, and dynamic situations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;as i mentioned in my last journal, i went back to JB on saturday for
CNY, and honestly, last week was just so much fun! finally got to spend
some quality time with my fam and relatives, catching up properly,
talking more, and getting to know a little bit more about everyone. 🥰 i
did so much better this time—heehee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNY definitely feels a little less exciting as i grow older 🥺, but
no matter what, i still love the vibes. the food, the red packets, the
mahjong (YES, i finally learnt how to play this year! but honestly... it
ain&#39;t my thing heehee), the gambling (without money for me!), the
laughter, the jokes, the stories, the memories—every little moment that
makes CNY feel like home. 🧧 even if the excitement fades a little with
age, i realise it&#39;s never really about the traditions themselves, but
the people we share them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but deep down, watching everyone get older and the kids grow up hits
differently now. there&#39;s this bittersweet feeling—like i wish i could
freeze time, just for a little while, and relive those moments again,
exactly as they were. but i guess that&#39;s just life, right? we grow up,
time moves forward, and all we can do is cherish what we have while we
still have it. 🥲&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;真的，时间啊，&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你怎么不在该慢的时候慢一些...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;你可以在我爱的人身上流失得慢一些么&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but even with these emotions lingering, there were so many beautiful
moments to hold onto. lo hey, fireworks, endless rounds of catching up,
and just chilling at home with family—those were easily the best parts
of the week. no matter how old i get, these are the moments i&#39;ll always
treasure. 🎆🧨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, there were some small conflicts here and there, but that&#39;s
just part of family dynamics. misunderstandings, miscommunications—it
happens. but at the end of the day, what matters is that we learn, we
grow, and we appreciate each other more. 🤝 after all, without the lows,
how would we ever truly appreciate the highs?&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;what a productive week at work! 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i finally released the feature that i conducted UAT for last year in
beijing, and honestly, what an indescribable feeling of seeing it go
live without a critical bug? OK TOUCH WOOD... 😳 &lt;strong&gt;it&#39;s moments
like these that remind me why i love what i do&lt;/strong&gt;—everything just
feels worth it. very good progress overall, and i couldn&#39;t be happier!
🥰💪🏼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another win this week was making strides in improving my
communication skills. i&#39;ve been focusing on active listening and giving
others the space to share their thoughts, and it&#39;s been so rewarding. i
also had a lovely lunch with a colleague from another team at paris
baguette—my virgin try! the food was really nice, and the company made
it even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the fitness front, i managed to push myself to a real to-failure
leg day on friday. but guys, did it hit hard... the soreness was real by
saturday, just in time for my trip to JB for chinese new year
celebrations. 🥲 and, of course, life had a little twist waiting for
me—while walking after tapping out of the mrt, i got the worst cramp in
my right calf muscle. it was so painful i had to stop walking and lean
against the wall with my eyes closed, trying to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as i stood there, i sensed someone looking at me. when i opened my
eyes, i saw this guy staring at me, his expression full of concern. he
raised his hand, clearly wanting to help. i shook my head and gave him
an &quot;OK&quot; 👌🏼 sign, reassuring him i was fine. even as he walked away, he
kept turning back to check on me. it&#39;s these little acts of kindness
that restore your faith in humanity and leave a lasting impression. that
stranger? he made my day, and i&#39;ll always remember his kindness. 🥹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it reminded me that even the smallest acts can mean so much to
someone, so i&#39;ll be sure to double it, and pass it on to the next person
whenever i can. 🌟&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-insights&quot;&gt;Reading Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been revisiting the book &lt;em&gt;Never Split the Difference&lt;/em&gt;
by Christopher Voss, making notes on the key takeaways and strategies
that resonate with me. you may check it out &lt;a

working on it! 📝&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">Highlights of the Week</h2><p>i haven't been so busy for quite a while, damn, it was such aproductive week! a few nights, i stayed up alone in the office, pouringin some extra effort just to complete things. one of the biggestaccomplishments was finishing my self-review for 2024. writing downreflections on each project i worked on really made me pause and thinkdeeply.</p><p>while writing my self-review on key outputs, i realised how much i'veparticipated in, but at the same time, i can't help but feel like icould have done more. it wasn't about slacking off, but how some tasksseemed almost too easy compared to my past experiences. don't get mewrong though—what i mean by "easy" is that it was less challenging interms of technical knowledge.</p><p>thinking back to project H (let's keep it hashed forconfidentiality), i remember how overwhelming it was at the start. therequirements were straightforward when i look at them now, but backthen?

&lt;p&gt;i haven&#39;t been so busy for quite a while, damn, it was such a
productive week! a few nights, i stayed up alone in the office, pouring
in some extra effort just to complete things. one of the biggest
accomplishments was finishing my self-review for 2024. writing down
reflections on each project i worked on really made me pause and think
deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while writing my self-review on key outputs, i realised how much i&#39;ve
participated in, but at the same time, i can&#39;t help but feel like i
could have done more. it wasn&#39;t about slacking off, but how some tasks
seemed almost too easy compared to my past experiences. don&#39;t get me
wrong though—what i mean by &quot;easy&quot; is that it was less challenging in
terms of technical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thinking back to project H (let&#39;s keep it hashed for
confidentiality), i remember how overwhelming it was at the start. the
requirements were straightforward when i look at them now, but back
then? oh boy, it was another story entirely. the business chinese
jargon? it felt like my brain hit a complete blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as someone raised in malaysia, speaking chinese, switching to malay
in secondary school, and then studying in singapore for three years
before settling here for over seven... let&#39;s just say my language system
got a serious workout. juggling those languages while trying to grasp
the project requirements? yeah, it was intense. i felt so out of my
depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when i look back at it now, (yes, i&#39;m smiling 🥹), jinghui, you’ve
come so far. you did so well! even those late nights staying up until
4am, panicking about whether you&#39;d make the deadline... you still made
it. all the mistakes you made during each project? they&#39;re the reason
you are where you are today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that realisation hit me deeply this week. it&#39;s moments like these
that remind me of why i push myself—to grow, to overcome, and to keep
building my confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;this week i made a conscious effort to be more productive at work-not
just to compensate for the time spent on my beijing trip, but also to
challenge myself. i wanted to prove that with the right mindset, i could
push my limits and achieve so much more. it&#39;s all about mental
resilience. at work, i&#39;ve been handling a requirement with manageable
complexity, but it demands a critical focus on detail. as part of my
goal this year, i&#39;m striving to do things &lt;strong&gt;well&lt;/strong&gt;, not
just get them done. it&#39;s about adopting the mindset of &lt;a
href=&quot;/goals-2025#:~:text=Done%20vs%20Done%20Well&quot;&gt;Done vs Done
Well&lt;/a&gt;, and this task is no exception. i&#39;ve been taking my time,
ensuring that the quality of my work aligns with that principle. it&#39;s
been challenging, but i&#39;m enjoying the process of learning and growing
in this area. 🎯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as for the weekend, it was nothing short of amazing! i had the chance
to gather with my relatives for an earlier Lo Hey (捞鱼生) @ &lt;a
href=&quot;https://g.co/kgs/egQyvhv&quot;&gt;TungLok Peking Duck Novena&lt;/a&gt;! it felt
so good to reconnect with them after such a long time, and it was a
great way to kick off the lunar new year celebrations! 🧧 on top of
that, it happened to be my aunty&#39;s birthday (肥肥妈妈). i surprised her
with a cake, and the restaraunt went extra mile-they presented the cake
on a large plate with dry ice underneath, creating an amazing fog
effect. to top it off, they played some chinese EDM birthday songs,
adding to the festive vibe HAHA! loved it so much, it was such a fun and
heartwarming moment. big up to 同乐 for making the celebration so
special!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-insights&quot;&gt;Reading Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as i have been kind of like relearning from the book of &lt;a
href=&quot;/never-split-the-difference-by-chris-voss/&quot;&gt;Never Split the
Differences by Chris Voss&lt;/a&gt;, i have been trying to revise and apply
some of the negotiation tactics in my daily life. it&#39;s been quite
interesting to see how these strategies can be used in various
situations, not just in business or high-stakes scenarios. i&#39;m still
working on mastering the art of tactical empathy and calibrated &quot;no,&quot;
but i&#39;m excited to see how these skills evolve over time. 📚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been utilising these methods in my conversations with
colleagues and friends, and it&#39;s been fascinating to observe the subtle
shifts in dynamics and outcomes. i&#39;m also trying to be more mindful of
my body language and tone of voice, as these non-verbal cues play a
significant role in communication. it&#39;s a work in progress, but i&#39;m
enjoying the process of learning and growing in this area. 💬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO! i was randomly cleaning up my Spotify&#39;s playlist and saw that i
have been following The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett podcast!
which i planned to listen but always forgot to... so i clicked on it and
saw a topic just caught my eye! &lt;a
href=&quot;https://youtu.be/VHUrdELKjDw?si=6QJh_KsPTkIMvgxP&quot;&gt;Body Language
Expert: Stop Using This, It’s Making People Dislike You, So Are These
Subtle Mistakes!&lt;/a&gt; and i was like, &quot;ok, that sounds interesting!&quot; so i
clicked on it and started listening to it. it was quite an insightful
episode, and i learned a lot about the importance of body language in
communication, she called it the language of cues. i&#39;ve always been
fascinated by the power of non-verbal cues, and this podcast episode
reinforced the idea that our body language can speak volumes about our
thoughts and emotions. it&#39;s a reminder to be more aware of how i present
myself in different situations and how i can use body language to
enhance my communication skills at work and in my personal life!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">Highlights of the Week</h2><p>the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparationfor the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijingtrip, i was a bit behind on the crew's routines and didn't get a chanceto practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so iput in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, wepulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks werelovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of theteam and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and wereally really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉</p><p>even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gymtime—because dedication doesn't take a break! the rest of the week wasabout catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of workand gym.</p><p>i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a newprotein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to alate-night mcd's supper—it's all about balance, right?

    <summary type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;highlights-of-the-week&quot;&gt;Highlights of the Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparation
for the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijing
trip, i was a bit behind on the crew&#39;s routines and didn&#39;t get a chance
to practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so i
put in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, we
pulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks were
lovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of the
team and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and we
really really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gym
time—because dedication doesn&#39;t take a break! the rest of the week was
about catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of work
and gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7
days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a new
protein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to a
late-night mcd&#39;s supper—it&#39;s all about balance, right? 🙊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;overall, it was a short but fulfilling week, blending beatboxing,
fitness, and a bit of relaxation. can&#39;t wait to see what the next week
brings!&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Never Split the Difference" is a book by Chris Voss, a former FBIhostage negotiator, that offers negotiation advice you can use in dailylife. The book is centered around the idea that traditional negotiationstrategies, like "splitting the difference," are often ineffective. Vossprovides a range of psychological strategies and tactics to use innegotiations, derived from his experience in dealing with criminals,terrorists, and other high-stakes situations.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Life is negotiation.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Key concepts from the book include:</p><ol type="1"><li><strong>Mirroring</strong>: Mimicking the other person's languageand behavior to build rapport.</li><li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Verbally acknowledging the other person'ssituation, feelings, or viewpoints.</li><li><strong>The "Accusation Audit"</strong>: Preemptively addressing allof the other party's potential accusations and concerns.</li><li><strong>Tactical Empathy</strong>: Understanding the feelings andmindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind thosefeelings so you increase your influence in all the moments thatfollow.</li><li><strong>The "Calibrated 'No'"</strong>: Saying "No" in a way thatinvites more discussion, as opposed to shutting it down.</li><li><strong>Bargaining Strategies</strong>: Like setting an "AnchorPrice" or using odd numbers to make a price seem more exact.</li><li><strong>The "Black Swan" Rule</strong>: The idea that there areunknown, unpredictable elements in every negotiation that can be used toyour advantage.</li></ol><hr /><h2 id="chapter-1-the-new-rules">Chapter 1: The New Rules</h2><p>The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home arenegotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalisticurge: <strong>I want</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“I want you to free the hostages,” is a very relevant one to thisbook, of course.</p></blockquote><p>But so is:</p><blockquote><p>“I want you to accept that $1 million contract.”</p><p>“I want to pay $20,000 for that car.”</p><p>“I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.” and</p><p>“I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m.”</p></blockquote><p>Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions—informationgathering and behaviour influencing—and includes almost any interactionwhere each party wants something from the other side.</p><blockquote><p>“I was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most potentnegotiating tools: the open-ended question. Today, after some yearsevolving these tactics for the private sector in my consultancy, TheBlack Swan Group, we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries thatthe other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buysyou time. <u>It gives your counterpart the illusion of control—they arethe one with the answers and power after all—and it does all thatwithout giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it.</u>”</p></blockquote><p>Psychotherapy research shows that <u>when individuals feel listenedto, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openlyevaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.</u> In addition,they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing tolisten to other points of view, which gets them to the calm and logicalplace where they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers.</p><p>Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you wantfrom—and with—other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitablein all relationships. So it’s useful—crucial, even—to know how to engagein that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage.</p><blockquote><p>“The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to getover your aversion to negotiating. You don’t need to like it; you justneed to understand that’s how the world works. <u>Negotiating does notmean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing theemotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you getwhat you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim yourprerogative to ask for what you think is right.</u></p><p>What this book is really about, then, is getting you to acceptnegotiation and in doing so learn how to get what you want in apsychologically aware way. You’ll learn to use your emotions, instincts,and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influencethem, and achieve more.</p><p>Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edgein every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence theirsizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what youwant.”</p></blockquote><hr /><h2 id="chapter-2-be-a-mirror">Chapter 2: Be A Mirror</h2><h3 id="assumption-blinds-hypothesis-guide">Assumption blinds,hypothesis guide</h3><p>Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possiblesurprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal thesurprises they are certain exist.</p><p>In negotiation, each new psychological insight or additional piece ofinformation revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discardone hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with amindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observeas much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of thereasons that really smart people often have trouble beingnegotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything todiscover.</p><blockquote><p>“until you know what you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’redealing with.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="calm-the-schizophrenic">Calm the Schizophrenic</h3><p>Schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in theirhead.</p><blockquote><p>“to avoid this, we need to apply true active listening which willdisarm the other party and make them feel heard, safe andunderstood.“</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they’ll smile back.Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical tothe success of just about every negotiating skill there is tolearn.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h3><p><u>Mirroring, also called isopraxism</u>, is essentially imitation.It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in whichwe copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speechpatterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’sgenerally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’shappening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and<u>establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.</u></p><p>It’s a phenomenon (and now technique) that follows a very basic butprofound biological principle: <u>We fear what’s different and are drawnto what’s similar.</u>”</p><blockquote><p>“mirror” is when you <u>repeat the last three words (or the criticalone to three words) of what someone has just said</u>. Of the entiretyof the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest onegets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.</p><p>By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroringinstinct and your counterpart <u>will inevitably elaborate on what wasjust said and sustain the process of connecting</u>. PsychologistRichard Wiseman created a study using waiters to identify what was themore effective method of creating a connection with strangers: mirroringor positive reinforcement.”</p></blockquote><p>and usually they will not repeat the same thing again, but willelaborate on it. This is the key to getting more information from theother party.</p><h3 id="how-to-confront-and-get-your-way-without-confrontation">How toConfront-And Get Your Way-Without Confrontation</h3><ol type="1"><li>Use the late-night FM DJ voice.</li><li>Start with “I’m sorry . . .”</li><li>Mirror.</li><li>Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic onyour counterpart.</li><li>Repeat.</li></ol><h3 id="key-lessons">Key lessons</h3><ul><li>A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possiblesurprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal thesurprises she is certain to find.</li><li>Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses anduse the negotiation to test them rigorously.</li><li>People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments becomeoverwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act ofbattle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as muchinformation as possible.</li><li>To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole andall-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.</li><li>Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes allnegotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, peoplecan feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapportand trust you’ve built.</li><li>Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame ofmind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate andproblem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mentalagility in both you and your counterpart.</li><li>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical oneto three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s differentand are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuatingsimilarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage theother side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy yourside time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal theirstrategy.</li></ul><h3 id="three-voice-tones-available-to-negotiators">Three Voice TonesAvailable to Negotiators</h3><ol type="1"><li><strong>The late-night FM DJ voice</strong>: Use selectively to makea point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. Whendone properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthinesswithout triggering defensiveness.</li><li><strong>The positive/playful voice</strong>: Should be your defaultvoice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Yourattitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smilewhile you’re talking.</li><li><strong>The direct or assertive voice</strong>: Used rarely. Willcause problems and create pushback.</li></ol><hr /><h2 id="chapter-3-dont-feel-their-pain-label-it">Chapter 3: Don't FeelTheir Pain, Label It</h2><blockquote><p>“How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions arethe problem?”</p></blockquote><h3 id="tactical-empathy">Tactical Empathy</h3><p>Empathy is the ability to recognise the perspective of a counterpart,and the vocalisation of that recognition</p><p>Tactical empathy is <u>understanding the feelings and mindset ofanother in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings</u>so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.</p><p>Empathy is a classic “soft” communication skill, but it has aphysical basis. When we closely observe a person’s face, gestures, andtone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process calledneural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think andfeel.</p><p>Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It’sabout understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemyis in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might movethem.</p><h3 id="labelling">Labelling</h3><p>Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledgingit. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with howthat person feels. It gets you close to someone without asking aboutexternal factors you know nothing about (“How’s your family?”). Think oflabeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack.</p><blockquote><p>“Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense.Exposing negative thoughts to daylight—“It looks like you don’t want togo back to jail”—makes them seem less frightening.</p><p>In one brain imaging study,2 psychology professor Matthew Liebermanof the University of California, Los Angeles, found that when people areshown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greateractivity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when theyare asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas thatgovern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion—applyingrational words to a fear—disrupts its raw intensity.”</p></blockquote><p>Label methods:</p><ol type="1"><li>It seems like...</li><li>It sounds like...</li><li>It looks like...</li></ol><p>The last rule of labeling is <u>silence</u>. Once you’ve thrown out alabel, be quiet and listen. We all have a tendency to expand on whatwe’ve said, to finish, “It seems like you like the way that shirtlooks,” with a specific question like “Where did you get it?” But alabel’s power is that it invites the other person to revealhimself.”</p><h2 id="wip-...">WIP ...</h2><hr /><h2 id="credits">Credits</h2><p>All quotes are excerpted from "Never Split the Difference:Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It by Chris Voss".

Be brutally honest</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><hr /><h2 id="chatgpt-4o">ChatGPT 4o</h2><p>Here are some tailored resolutions for the new year, based on yourprofile and goals. They aim to address growth opportunities, refine yourstrengths, and challenge your limitations:</p><ol type="1"><li><p>Sharpen Focus on Long-Term Career Goals</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> You have a strong technical foundation andleadership experience, but you're still seeking alignment between yourcurrent work and the broader industry.</p><p>• <strong>Action:</strong> Set a clear 5-year plan and evaluate eachproject for its relevance to your ultimate goals (e.g., transitioning toa dream company like Google or excelling in high-impact roles likeProduction Engineer). Prioritise skills and projects that bring youcloser to these goals.</p></li><li><p>Build Depth in Key Technologies</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your expertise spans a wide array of toolsand platforms, but depth in fewer cutting-edge technologies (e.g.,Elixir or advanced DevOps practices) can set you apart.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Commit to mastering one high-demandtechnology. Build a side project that demonstrates your expertise, withthe goal of open-sourcing it or presenting it at a techconference.</p></li><li><p>Elevate Your Personal Brand</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your personal website and online presence arestrong, but refining them with the modern polish and interactivity youaim for can elevate your visibility.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Finish the v4 of your website, ensuring itreflects your skills dynamically (e.g., interactive portfolios, engagingvisuals, and a story-driven “About Me”). Incorporate beatboxing toshowcase your unique personality alongside professionalachievements.</p></li><li><p>Prioritise Consistency Over Intensity</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your projects often reflect deep effort butsuffer from scope creep and delayed timelines. This pattern could affectperception of reliability in team or stakeholder settings.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Break big goals into manageable,measurable chunks. Use tools like OKRs to stay consistent and realisticabout deliverables. Document progress clearly to manageexpectations.</p></li><li><p>Embrace Vulnerability and Human Connection</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your focus on professionalism sometimesovershadows the emotional authenticity that builds deeper relationships.This may affect personal and professional connections.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Let go of perfectionism in relationships(both personal and professional). Share your challenges, seek genuinefeedback, and make room for imperfections in others as well.</p></li><li><p>Balance Hectic with Holistic</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your gym schedule and work ethic arecommendable but seem to leave little room for reflection and emotionalrecharge.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Integrate mindfulness or journaling intoyour routine. Dedicate one day a month to complete disconnection—nocoding, no emails, no gym. Use it for rest, reading, or exploringsomething entirely new.</p></li><li><p>Date with Clarity and Confidence</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Your reflections on past dates show emotionaldepth but a tendency to overanalyse.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Approach dating as an opportunity to learnand enjoy, not as a test. Set clear boundaries and communicate yourintentions upfront. Trust your instincts to know when someone isn't theright fit.</p></li><li><p>Invest in Financial Literacy</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> You've shown interest in investments likefractional stocks, but expanding financial acumen could offer long-termstability and freedom.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Dive deeper into investment strategies.Consider automating contributions to ETFs like VOO, learning aboutREITs, or exploring small-scale entrepreneurial ventures like owning anAnytime Fitness gym.</p></li><li><p>Advocate for Yourself and Your Team</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> You're often focused on solutions andprojects, but advocating for your team's or your own success couldposition you as a stronger leader.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Practice self-promotion withouthesitation. Document team wins and challenges, and share them openlywith stakeholders to highlight value and leadership.</p></li><li><p>Let Go of ‘What Ifs'</p><p>• <strong>Why?</strong> Reflections on relationships, misseddeadlines, or professional missteps sometimes hold you back.</p><p>• <strong>Action</strong>: Embrace a growth mindset. Celebrate thelessons from failures without overanalysing what could have been.Channel this into actionable steps for the future.</p></li></ol><p>Would you like me to help break down any of these resolutions intospecific actions?</p><hr /><h2 id="chatgpt-1o">ChatGPT 1o</h2><p>Below are several suggestions for your New Year's resolutions,tailored to what I understand are your aspirations and experiences. Ihave endeavoured to be frank yet constructive, and I hope these ideaswill provide a solid foundation for the year ahead.</p><ol type="1"><li>Pursue Further Education with Purpose</li></ol><blockquote><p>You have mentioned an interest in obtaining a part-time degree. Bebrutally honest with yourself about which area of study will bestcomplement both your technical and managerial career path. If you areconvinced a degree is necessary, commit wholeheartedly: map out adetailed plan of how you'll balance work, study, and personal life. Ifnot, channel the same drive into pursuing targeted professionalcertifications in cloud architecture, data engineering, or evenexecutive leadership.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will decide on a specificprogramme or certification by 1 March and formalise my enrolment orstudy schedule by the following month.”</p><ol start="2" type="1"><li>Hone Your Leadership Skills</li></ol><blockquote><p>You are already adept at managing teams and liaising with clients,but leadership is a lifelong pursuit of refinement. Focus on areas youmay find challenging—maybe delegation, conflict resolution, or inspiringinnovative thinking. Solicit candid feedback from peers, subordinates,and mentors; it might be uncomfortable, but that's where growthhappens.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will organise quarterly‘listening sessions' with my team to gather honest feedback on myleadership style and commit to implementing at least one suggestedimprovement each quarter.”</p><ol start="3" type="1"><li>Strengthen Your Technical Core</li></ol><blockquote><p>Although you are already highly competent in multiple codinglanguages, take a brutally honest look at your ‘weak links'—the newertechnologies or deeper aspects of a technology you use daily but haven'ttruly mastered. It might be advanced concepts in Elixir or leveragingthe full potential of Terraform for large-scale infrastructure. Even thestrongest technical leads are never done learning.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will complete a hands-onproject or course in a cutting-edge framework (e.g., a new dataprocessing tool or advanced AWS service) and share the results with myteam by mid-year.”</p><ol start="4" type="1"><li>Pay Attention to Work–Life Balance</li></ol><blockquote><p>While you are clearly industrious, burnout is a real risk. Whetherit's allocating time for fitness, mindfulness, or creative hobbies,ensure you are not running on fumes. Consistency here is key; commit toa routine that supports your mental and physical well-being.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will take two 20-minutebreaks per workday for a brisk walk or short workout session, ensuring Ilog these activities to keep track of my consistency.”</p><ol start="5" type="1"><li>Expand Your Global Perspective</li></ol><blockquote><p>With your multilingual abilities, you have a strong base forintercultural communication. If you feel comfortable in your currentlanguages, consider brushing up on business-level proficiency or divinginto a new language. Alternatively, explore the cultural nuances andglobal aspects of your field—understanding international markets anduser experiences could give you an edge in project management andproduct design.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will read at least one bookor research paper every month on international tech markets orcross-cultural leadership, summarising the insights for my team.”</p><ol start="6" type="1"><li>Refine Your Personal Brand</li></ol><blockquote><p>Beyond simply doing great work, think about how you present yourexpertise and leadership. If you have not done so already, build orupdate a personal website or portfolio showcasing your codingcontributions, project management experience, and professionalphilosophy. Cultivate thoughtful social media posts or LinkedIn articleson your technical and managerial insights.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will publish two in-deptharticles on LinkedIn or a personal blog this year, focusing on topicssuch as best practices in DevOps or effective client-stakeholdercommunication.”</p><ol start="7" type="1"><li>Continue Exploring New Ideas for Personal Growth</li></ol><blockquote><p>You've shown interest in seeking guidance and exploring lessconventional paths (such as consulting a fortune teller). Keep an openmind about any avenue that helps you clarify your goals. At the sametime, keep a healthy balance between external guidance and your ownintuition. Sometimes introspection—through journalling or speaking witha trusted mentor—can provide more practical clarity than you mightexpect.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Example Resolution</strong>: “I will commit to monthlypersonal reflection sessions—whether that's with a mentor, aprofessional counsellor, or through a structured journaling process—toensure I'm aligning my professional and personal objectives.”</p><p>Extra Topics You Might Enjoy Exploring Further</p><ol type="1"><li><p>Open-Source Leadership</p><p>• Investigate how contributing to or initiating open-source projectscan sharpen your technical and collaboration skills.</p></li><li><p>Emerging Tech for Sustainability</p><p>• Explore how technology can tackle environmental challenges; yourbackground could be pivotal in making a positive impact in green techinitiatives.</p></li><li><p>Behavioural Economics in Tech</p><p>• Delve into how user behaviour and decision-making can influenceproduct design, enhancing your UI/UX expertise.</p></li><li><p>Philosophies in Leadership</p><p>• Read about Stoicism or other schools of thought, seeing how theymight inform steadier, more empathetic leadership styles.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In being brutally honest, the main point is not to overcommit. Ahandful of well-chosen resolutions—executed thoroughly—will accomplishmore than a grand wish-list you cannot realistically maintain. Eachresolution should serve a clear purpose: professional advancement,well-being, or personal fulfilment. By staying true to your vision,proactively seeking feedback, and broadening your expertise, you'll befar better positioned to navigate the coming year with confidence.</p><p>I wish you every success in following through with your goals, and Ihope these resolutions provide some direction for a fulfilling andimpactful new year.</p><hr /><h2 id="reflections-on-the-advice">Reflections on the Advice</h2><p>wow... i'm speechless... the advice from both ChatGPT 4o and 1o isincredibly insightful and thought-provoking. it's like they've seenthrough my facade and pinpointed areas where i need to grow, improve,and take action. i have so much to digest and reflect on. i will keepupdating this post as i work on these resolutions and share my progress.here's to a year of growth, challenges, and transformation. 🌟</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-last-journal-of-2024">my last journal of 2024 🫶🏻</h2><p>hello, dear reader!</p><p>it's been a while since my last journal, and now, here we are—daysaway from 2025. this marks my final journal entry for 2024, and there'sso much i want to share!</p><p>december has been an intense month. so much has happened that i'm noteven sure where to start. but let's take it one story at a time.</p><span id="more"></span><p>on the 6th of december, friday, i received some shockingannouncements at work (the details are confidential, so i can't sharemuch here). at that moment, i was completely thrown off—stunned andunsure how to react. you know those moments when life blindsides you?this was one of them. i didn't know how to process it, but i toldmyself, "what's done is done. all you can do now is focus on how yourespond." so that's what i tried to do.</p><p>on the bright side, one part of the announcement i can share is thati got the opportunity to go on a solo business trip for a project i wasresponsible for! honestly, it was nerve-wracking—my first time travelingalone for work, handling everything by myself. i was unprepared,worried, and unsure. but looking back, i think i did okay. the triptaught me a lot, and after reflecting on it, i know there's still somuch room for growth.</p><p>that friday was a blur. after the announcement, i had no time toprocess anything before rushing off to grab a quick lunch betweenmeetings. it was a whirlwind of emotions—shock, confusion, gratitude,and everything in between. but amidst the chaos, my amazing team gave mea sweet moment to pause. they surprised me with a cake and coffee for mybirthday! 🥺 they're honestly the best, and i felt so touched that theyremembered despite how busy everything was. it was a reminder of howlucky i am to work with such thoughtful people. 😭</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9089.jpeg" class="" title="happy me ☺️"><p>of course, there was no time to rest. meetings filled up the rest ofthe day. but shoutout to my colleague, <strong>junjie</strong>, whohelped me sort out logistics like drafting my business travel letter. hemade my life so much easier, and i'm super grateful for hiskindness.</p><hr /><p>now, about the trip—Beijing was incredible! i finally got to visitByteDance's headquarters at 大钟侍 and another office at 融中心. the16-day business trip was a whirlwind of productivity and newexperiences. my primary objective was to oversee the UAT process andensure a successful project delivery. while the workload was intense,meeting colleagues and stakeholders in person brought a refreshing humanconnection that had been missing during months of remote collaboration.being on-site allowed me to dive deeper into project challenges,brainstorm solutions face-to-face, and even build stronger rapport withthe team. honestly, it was more than just a work trip—it felt like anopportunity to grow both professionally and personally.</p><p><strong>融中心</strong>:</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9274.jpeg" class="large"><p><strong>大钟侍</strong>:</p><video width="auto" height="auto" controls><source src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9275_compressed.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><p><strong>curious about what my ByteDance life looks like, especiallyduring my time in the Beijing offices?</strong></p><p>i've captured some highlights and behind-the-scenes moments from myjourney in a special Instagram highlight titled <strong>ByteDance2</strong> &amp; <strong>ByteDance 2.1</strong>. feel free to check itout <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9lbmtyMS8=">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>—you might justcatch a glimpse of my day-to-day adventures, the breathtaking officeviews, and the vibrant city life! 😊</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/ig-stories.png" class=""><hr /><p>the weekends in Beijing were magical. i went on solo adventures,ticking off places i'd always wanted to visit. walking through thehistorical 胡同s, soaking in the vibe of the city—it felt like steppinginto a movie. 🥺</p><p>one of my first stops was 天坛公园. i was in awe of the ancientchinese architecture—it's just so majestic and grand. every detail ofthe buildings felt like a glimpse into the past, and i couldn't help butadmire how much history they carry.</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9699.jpeg" class="" title="祈谷坛祈年殿"><p>then, there was the 故宫—absolutely speechless. i mean, this was oncethe emperor's home... the sheer size of it left me in disbelief. i foundmyself wandering through the halls, just imagining what life must havebeen like back then.</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9818.jpeg" class="" title="参观故宫"><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9862.jpeg" class="" title="藻井"><p>another highlight was finally trying 四季民福. i've seen it all over小红书, and i can confirm—it totally lives up to the hype. the food wasamazing, and it was such a treat to tick it off my list.</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9913.jpeg" class="" title="北京烤鸭"><p>i also spent some time at 颐和园 and 圆明园, two parks that couldn'tbe more different but both so special in their own way. 颐和园 was sopeaceful and relaxing, a perfect place to just slow down and take abreath. meanwhile, the ruins at 圆明园 felt like a quiet reminder ofhistory, bittersweet yet humbling to see in person.</p><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0068.jpeg" class="" title="颐和园"><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0134.jpeg" class="" title="池塘里的鲤鱼都好大只"><img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0169.jpeg" class="" title="圆明园"><p>南锣鼓巷 was another favourite. i caught the sunset here, and let metell you, it was breathtaking.

&lt;p&gt;i lost my voice the very day i planned to record the voices beatbox
wildcard. it was like universe was playing a cruel joke on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;honestly, my routine wasn&#39;t 100% ready, but losing my voice made
everything feel worse... 😔 i still don&#39;t know what caused it, but it
was the first time in my life that i almost completely lost my
voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, instead of giving up, i threw together a freestyle beat in the
office-a routine i literally came up with in like an hour... i recorded
it, posted it, and hoped for the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unfortunately, my impromptu routine didn&#39;t pass the wildcard
selection. and yeah, i was so mad at myself. 😤 firstly, i could&#39;ve
prepared and recorded earlier instead of leaving it until the last
minute; secondly, i knew deep down that i didn&#39;t put in the effort i
should&#39;ve. i&#39;m really disappointed in myself, but i also know this is a
lesson to carry forward. 🥺😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this week, i fully immersed myself in Atomic Habits by James Clear.
as i delved into it, i realised just how much the ideas resonate with
me. some of the principles, like focusing on small changes, are things
i&#39;ve unconsciously applied in my life. but this book made me aware of
how i can refine and strengthen those actions to create a more effective
&quot;system&quot; for myself. it&#39;s genuinely inspiring and i can already feel it
reshaping my mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here are some key highlights from Chapter 1 that struck a chord with
me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“improving by 1 percent isn&#39;t particularly notable—sometimes it
isn&#39;t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in
the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is
astounding. Here&#39;s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent
better each day for one year, you&#39;ll end up thirty-seven times better by
the time you&#39;re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day
for one year, you&#39;ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a
very different destination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your
future self.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major
change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter Summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against
you, which is why understanding the details is essential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding
process are delayed. You need to be patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&#39;s really all about the systems—this line hit me the hardest: you
do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your
systems. looking at my own life, i realise how much my systems need
improvement, and i feel motivated to start making these 1% changes, even
if they seem small right now.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

throat back that i completely lost my voice halfway through the day at
work. 😭 thank god for the clinic right next to our office that&#39;s
covered by insurance-it was so convenient. i literally just gave em my
name, talked to the doc, grabbed my meds and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the doc gave me 2 days of mc, but i still went to work the next day.
idk, maybe i was just feeling guilty about taking a day off, but
honestly, my body was sreaming at me to rest. so the day after, i
finally listened. ended up sleeping for 11 hours straight... and omg,
that was the rest i needed! felt so much better afterwards! FULL

&lt;p&gt;this week was intense... a full 7/7 work grind 😔 by friday nightm i
was so wiped out that i just passed out like that and slept for more
than 9 hours straight! woke up and barely had time to catch my breath
before rushing off to work again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;even though it was hectic, i found a bit of thrill in the unknown
challenges and a sense of satisfaction in pushing through. 🎯💪🏼🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND guess what! F26 canteen is gonna reopen next week! OMG finally!
😭🤞🏼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for my beatboxing practice, with 25 days until the comp and 14 days
left to finish my wildcard, i&#39;m giving it my all. i&#39;m trusting the
process, feeling like i&#39;m hitting a low right before the climb. it&#39;s
that moment when u&#39;re going down the hill, but i&#39;m so ready to rise any
time! 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;watch me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-insights&quot;&gt;Reading Insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have been revisiting the book &lt;em&gt;Never Split the Difference&lt;/em&gt;
by Christopher Voss, a book that&#39;s almost become a life strategy guide
for me. i know relying heavily on one book isn&#39;t ideal, but i find
myself &lt;strong&gt;taking the parts that resonate, filtering what feels
right, and testing out those ideas in real life&lt;/strong&gt;. some of the
techniques? they actually work wonders in human interactions—it&#39;s
fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rereading has been a refreshing way to catch details i might have
missed the first time. it&#39;s funny how information can just slip through
ur mind without u even noticing, so a good review always feels
worthwhile. 📝&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
