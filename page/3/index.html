          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparation
for the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijing
trip, i was a bit behind on the crew's routines and didn't get a chance
to practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so i
put in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, we
pulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks were
lovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of the
team and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and we
really really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉</p>
<p>even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gym
time—because dedication doesn't take a break! the rest of the week was
about catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of work
and gym.</p>
<p>i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7
days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a new
protein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to a
late-night mcd's supper—it's all about balance, right? 🙊</p>

          <p>"Never Split the Difference" is a book by Chris Voss, a former FBI
hostage negotiator, that offers negotiation advice you can use in daily
life. The book is centered around the idea that traditional negotiation
strategies, like "splitting the difference," are often ineffective. Voss
provides a range of psychological strategies and tactics to use in
negotiations, derived from his experience in dealing with criminals,
terrorists, and other high-stakes situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Life is negotiation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key concepts from the book include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mirroring</strong>: Mimicking the other person's language
and behavior to build rapport.</li>
<li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Verbally acknowledging the other person's
situation, feelings, or viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>The "Accusation Audit"</strong>: Preemptively addressing all
of the other party's potential accusations and concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Empathy</strong>: Understanding the feelings and
mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those
feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that
follow.</li>
<li><strong>The "Calibrated 'No'"</strong>: Saying "No" in a way that
invites more discussion, as opposed to shutting it down.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining Strategies</strong>: Like setting an "Anchor
Price" or using odd numbers to make a price seem more exact.</li>
<li><strong>The "Black Swan" Rule</strong>: The idea that there are
unknown, unpredictable elements in every negotiation that can be used to
your advantage.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-new-rules">Chapter 1: The New Rules</h2>
<p>The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home are
negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic
urge: <strong>I want</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want you to free the hostages,” is a very relevant one to this
book, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But so is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want you to accept that $1 million contract.”</p>
<p>“I want to pay $20,000 for that car.”</p>
<p>“I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.” and</p>
<p>“I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions—information
gathering and behaviour influencing—and includes almost any interaction
where each party wants something from the other side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most potent
negotiating tools: the open-ended question. Today, after some years
evolving these tactics for the private sector in my consultancy, The
Black Swan Group, we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that
the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys
you time. <u>It gives your counterpart the illusion of control—they are
the one with the answers and power after all—and it does all that
without giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it.</u>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychotherapy research shows that <u>when individuals feel listened
to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly
evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.</u> In addition,
they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to
listen to other points of view, which gets them to the calm and logical
place where they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers.</p>
<p>Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you want
from—and with—other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable
in all relationships. So it’s useful—crucial, even—to know how to engage
in that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get
over your aversion to negotiating. You don’t need to like it; you just
need to understand that’s how the world works. <u>Negotiating does not
mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the
emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get
what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your
prerogative to ask for what you think is right.</u></p>
<p>What this book is really about, then, is getting you to accept
negotiation and in doing so learn how to get what you want in a
psychologically aware way. You’ll learn to use your emotions, instincts,
and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influence
them, and achieve more.</p>
<p>Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge
in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their
sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you
want.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter-2-be-a-mirror">Chapter 2: Be A Mirror</h2>
<h3 id="assumption-blinds-hypothesis-guide">Assumption blinds,
hypothesis guide</h3>
<p>Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible
surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the
surprises they are certain exist.</p>
<p>In negotiation, each new psychological insight or additional piece of
information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard
one hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a
mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe
as much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of the
reasons that really smart people often have trouble being
negotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to
discover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“until you know what you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’re
dealing with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="calm-the-schizophrenic">Calm the Schizophrenic</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their
head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“to avoid this, we need to apply true active listening which will
disarm the other party and make them feel heard, safe and
understood.“</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they’ll smile back.
Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical to
the success of just about every negotiating skill there is to
learn.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h3>
<p><u>Mirroring, also called isopraxism</u>, is essentially imitation.
It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which
we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech
patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s
generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s
happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and
<u>establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.</u></p>
<p>It’s a phenomenon (and now technique) that follows a very basic but
profound biological principle: <u>We fear what’s different and are drawn
to what’s similar.</u>”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“mirror” is when you <u>repeat the last three words (or the critical
one to three words) of what someone has just said</u>. Of the entirety
of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one
gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.</p>
<p>By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring
instinct and your counterpart <u>will inevitably elaborate on what was
just said and sustain the process of connecting</u>. Psychologist
Richard Wiseman created a study using waiters to identify what was the
more effective method of creating a connection with strangers: mirroring
or positive reinforcement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and usually they will not repeat the same thing again, but will
elaborate on it. This is the key to getting more information from the
other party.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-confront-and-get-your-way-without-confrontation">How to
Confront-And Get Your Way-Without Confrontation</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the late-night FM DJ voice.</li>
<li>Start with “I’m sorry . . .”</li>
<li>Mirror.</li>
<li>Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on
your counterpart.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-lessons">Key lessons</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible
surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the
surprises she is certain to find.</li>
<li>Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and
use the negotiation to test them rigorously.</li>
<li>People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become
overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of
battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much
information as possible.</li>
<li>To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and
all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.</li>
<li>Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all
negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people
can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport
and trust you’ve built.</li>
<li>Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of
mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and
problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental
agility in both you and your counterpart.</li>
<li>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one
to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different
and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating
similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the
other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your
side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their
strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-voice-tones-available-to-negotiators">Three Voice Tones
Available to Negotiators</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The late-night FM DJ voice</strong>: Use selectively to make
a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When
done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness
without triggering defensiveness.</li>
<li><strong>The positive/playful voice</strong>: Should be your default
voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your
attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile
while you’re talking.</li>
<li><strong>The direct or assertive voice</strong>: Used rarely. Will
cause problems and create pushback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="chapter-3-dont-feel-their-pain-label-it">Chapter 3: Don't Feel
Their Pain, Label It</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are
the problem?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tactical-empathy">Tactical Empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy is the ability to recognise the perspective of a counterpart,
and the vocalisation of that recognition</p>
<p>Tactical empathy is <u>understanding the feelings and mindset of
another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings</u>
so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.</p>
<p>Empathy is a classic “soft” communication skill, but it has a
physical basis. When we closely observe a person’s face, gestures, and
tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called
neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and
feel.</p>
<p>Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It’s
about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy
is in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might move
them.</p>
<h3 id="labelling">Labelling</h3>
<p>Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging
it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how
that person feels. It gets you close to someone without asking about
external factors you know nothing about (“How’s your family?”). Think of
labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense.
Exposing negative thoughts to daylight—“It looks like you don’t want to
go back to jail”—makes them seem less frightening.</p>
<p>In one brain imaging study,2 psychology professor Matthew Lieberman
of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that when people are
shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater
activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when they
are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that
govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion—applying
rational words to a fear—disrupts its raw intensity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Label methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It seems like...</li>
<li>It sounds like...</li>
<li>It looks like...</li>
</ol>
<p>The last rule of labeling is <u>silence</u>. Once you’ve thrown out a
label, be quiet and listen. We all have a tendency to expand on what
we’ve said, to finish, “It seems like you like the way that shirt
looks,” with a specific question like “Where did you get it?” But a
label’s power is that it invites the other person to reveal
himself.”</p>

          <h2 id="my-last-journal-of-2024">my last journal of 2024 🫶🏻</h2>
<p>hello, dear reader!</p>
<p>it's been a while since my last journal, and now, here we are—days
away from 2025. this marks my final journal entry for 2024, and there's
so much i want to share!</p>
<p>december has been an intense month. so much has happened that i'm not
even sure where to start. but let's take it one story at a time.</p>
<p>on the 6th of december, friday, i received some shocking
announcements at work (the details are confidential, so i can't share
much here). at that moment, i was completely thrown off—stunned and
unsure how to react. you know those moments when life blindsides you?
this was one of them. i didn't know how to process it, but i told
myself, "what's done is done. all you can do now is focus on how you
respond." so that's what i tried to do.</p>
<p>on the bright side, one part of the announcement i can share is that
i got the opportunity to go on a solo business trip for a project i was
responsible for! honestly, it was nerve-wracking—my first time traveling
alone for work, handling everything by myself. i was unprepared,
worried, and unsure. but looking back, i think i did okay. the trip
taught me a lot, and after reflecting on it, i know there's still so
much room for growth.</p>
<p>that friday was a blur. after the announcement, i had no time to
process anything before rushing off to grab a quick lunch between
meetings. it was a whirlwind of emotions—shock, confusion, gratitude,
and everything in between. but amidst the chaos, my amazing team gave me
a sweet moment to pause. they surprised me with a cake and coffee for my
birthday! 🥺 they're honestly the best, and i felt so touched that they
remembered despite how busy everything was. it was a reminder of how
lucky i am to work with such thoughtful people. 😭</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9089.jpeg" class="" title="happy me ☺️">
<p>of course, there was no time to rest. meetings filled up the rest of
the day. but shoutout to my colleague, <strong>junjie</strong>, who
helped me sort out logistics like drafting my business travel letter. he
made my life so much easier, and i'm super grateful for his
kindness.</p>
<hr />
<p>now, about the trip—Beijing was incredible! i finally got to visit
ByteDance's headquarters at 大钟侍 and another office at 融中心. the
16-day business trip was a whirlwind of productivity and new
experiences. my primary objective was to oversee the UAT process and
ensure a successful project delivery. while the workload was intense,
meeting colleagues and stakeholders in person brought a refreshing human
connection that had been missing during months of remote collaboration.
being on-site allowed me to dive deeper into project challenges,
brainstorm solutions face-to-face, and even build stronger rapport with
the team. honestly, it was more than just a work trip—it felt like an
opportunity to grow both professionally and personally.</p>

<p><strong>curious about what my ByteDance life looks like, especially
during my time in the Beijing offices?</strong></p>
<p>i've captured some highlights and behind-the-scenes moments from my
journey in a special Instagram highlight titled <strong>ByteDance
2</strong> &amp; <strong>ByteDance 2.1</strong>. feel free to check it
out <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9lbmtyMS8=">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>—you might just
catch a glimpse of my day-to-day adventures, the breathtaking office
views, and the vibrant city life! 😊</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/ig-stories.png" class="">
<hr />
<p>the weekends in Beijing were magical. i went on solo adventures,
ticking off places i'd always wanted to visit. walking through the
historical 胡同s, soaking in the vibe of the city—it felt like stepping
into a movie. 🥺</p>
<p>one of my first stops was 天坛公园. i was in awe of the ancient
chinese architecture—it's just so majestic and grand. every detail of
the buildings felt like a glimpse into the past, and i couldn't help but
admire how much history they carry.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9699.jpeg" class="" title="祈谷坛祈年殿">
<p>then, there was the 故宫—absolutely speechless. i mean, this was once
the emperor's home... the sheer size of it left me in disbelief. i found
myself wandering through the halls, just imagining what life must have
been like back then.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9818.jpeg" class="" title="参观故宫">
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9862.jpeg" class="" title="藻井">
<p>another highlight was finally trying 四季民福. i've seen it all over
小红书, and i can confirm—it totally lives up to the hype. the food was
amazing, and it was such a treat to tick it off my list.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9913.jpeg" class="" title="北京烤鸭">
<p>i also spent some time at 颐和园 and 圆明园, two parks that couldn't
be more different but both so special in their own way. 颐和园 was so
peaceful and relaxing, a perfect place to just slow down and take a
breath. meanwhile, the ruins at 圆明园 felt like a quiet reminder of
history, bittersweet yet humbling to see in person.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0068.jpeg" class="" title="颐和园">
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0134.jpeg" class="" title="池塘里的鲤鱼都好大只">
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0169.jpeg" class="" title="圆明园">
<p>南锣鼓巷 was another favourite. i caught the sunset here, and let me
tell you, it was breathtaking. Beijing's winter sunsets hit
differently—so early, around 4pm, but the glow it left in the sky was
unforgettable. 🌅</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0225.jpeg" class="" title="在南锣鼓巷街上看日落">
<p>and, of course, i couldn't miss 什刹海, strolling by the lakes,
surrounded by locals and tourists alike. it had such a vibrant energy,
yet it felt calming at the same time.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0262.jpeg" class="" title="什刹海">
<p>these moments brought me so much joy. every place i visited left an
impression, and i know i'll carry these memories with me forever.
Beijing really has a charm that's hard to put into words—it's a mix of
history, culture, and just pure magic. 🥺🫶🏻</p>
<hr />
<p>but as december went on, it wasn't all smooth sailing. just a week
after the initial announcement, my leader shared that the decision had
been cancelled. i hadn't even fully processed the first news when the
second hit. it was an emotional rollercoaster—relief, confusion, and
gratitude all at once. but i reminded myself: <strong>What lies behind
us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within
us.</strong> life is unpredictable, and sometimes all you can do is
adapt and move forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>as the year-end approached, i took some much-needed leaves. i
originally planned a trip to phuket in mid-december, but with the
business travel and the critical project release, i had to cancel it.
instead, i used the time to rest, recharge, and reflect. honestly, it
turned out to be a blessing in disguise—having that "me time" was
exactly what i needed.</p>
<p>before closing the year, my crew, Obelisk, and i worked on a
countdown beatbox performance for the new year's eve celebration. it was
such a fun project, and i'm so excited to see how it turns out on the
31st! 🎉</p>
<p>thank you for being part of my journey this year. ❤️</p>
<p>this isn't a full reflection of 2024—i'll save that for my next blog.
but for now, here's to closing the year on a hopeful note.</p>
<p>bring it on, 2025! 🎯</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>i lost my voice the very day i planned to record the voices beatbox
wildcard. it was like universe was playing a cruel joke on me.</p>
<p>honestly, my routine wasn't 100% ready, but losing my voice made
everything feel worse... 😔 i still don't know what caused it, but it
was the first time in my life that i almost completely lost my
voice.</p>
<p>so, instead of giving up, i threw together a freestyle beat in the
office-a routine i literally came up with in like an hour... i recorded
it, posted it, and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>unfortunately, my impromptu routine didn't pass the wildcard
selection. and yeah, i was so mad at myself. 😤 firstly, i could've
prepared and recorded earlier instead of leaving it until the last
minute; secondly, i knew deep down that i didn't put in the effort i
should've. i'm really disappointed in myself, but i also know this is a
lesson to carry forward. 🥺😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>this week, i fully immersed myself in Atomic Habits by James Clear.
as i delved into it, i realised just how much the ideas resonate with
me. some of the principles, like focusing on small changes, are things
i've unconsciously applied in my life. but this book made me aware of
how i can refine and strengthen those actions to create a more effective
"system" for myself. it's genuinely inspiring and i can already feel it
reshaping my mindset.</p>
<p>here are some key highlights from Chapter 1 that struck a chord with
me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable—sometimes it
isn't even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in
the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is
astounding. Here's how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent
better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by
the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day
for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small
win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.”</p></li>
<li><p>“a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a
very different destination.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your
future self.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major
change.”</p></li>
<li><p>“habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's
frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere.
It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes
are delayed.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time
thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your
systems.”</p></li>
<li><p>“We think we need to change our results, but the results are not
the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause
those results.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall
in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait
to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime
your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different
forms, not just the one you first envision.”</p></li>
<li><p>“The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process
that will determine your progress.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</li>
<li>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against
you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li>
<li>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding
process are delayed. You need to be patient.</li>
<li>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Excerpt From Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results James
Clear - This material may be protected by copyright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it's really all about the systems—this line hit me the hardest: you
do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your
systems. looking at my own life, i realise how much my systems need
improvement, and i feel motivated to start making these 1% changes, even
if they seem small right now.</p>

<p>i went on a trip to China for the first time! omg, i don't know where
to start... it was amazing. honestly, i don't think i can put in into
words, ok, so i'll let the pictures do the talking this time. pictures
speak a thousand words, right? 🥹</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i will just attach some of my favourite pictures later~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on a less cheerful note, i came back with a really really bad sore
throat back that i completely lost my voice halfway through the day at
work. 😭 thank god for the clinic right next to our office that's
covered by insurance-it was so convenient. i literally just gave em my
name, talked to the doc, grabbed my meds and left.</p>
<p>the doc gave me 2 days of mc, but i still went to work the next day.
idk, maybe i was just feeling guilty about taking a day off, but
honestly, my body was sreaming at me to rest. so the day after, i
finally listened. ended up sleeping for 11 hours straight... and omg,
that was the rest i needed! felt so much better afterwards! FULL
RECHARGED! 🔋</p>
<p>but my voice still... and my beatbox competition is approaching
😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>AND i finally started reading <strong>Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;
Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones by James
Clear</strong>! it's been on my reading list for ages, and i am so
excited to dive into it. just flipping through the first few pages has
already given me a glimpse of how impactful this book could be for
making lasting changes. i can't wait to apply these principles to my
daily life!</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week was intense... a full 7/7 work grind 😔 by friday nightm i
was so wiped out that i just passed out like that and slept for more
than 9 hours straight! woke up and barely had time to catch my breath
before rushing off to work again.</p>
<p>even though it was hectic, i found a bit of thrill in the unknown
challenges and a sense of satisfaction in pushing through. 🎯💪🏼🔥</p>
<p>AND guess what! F26 canteen is gonna reopen next week! OMG finally!
😭🤞🏼</p>
<p>for my beatboxing practice, with 25 days until the comp and 14 days
left to finish my wildcard, i'm giving it my all. i'm trusting the
process, feeling like i'm hitting a low right before the climb. it's
that moment when u're going down the hill, but i'm so ready to rise any
time! 🔥</p>
<p>watch me.</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>i have been revisiting the book <em>Never Split the Difference</em>
by Christopher Voss, a book that's almost become a life strategy guide
for me. i know relying heavily on one book isn't ideal, but i find
myself <strong>taking the parts that resonate, filtering what feels
right, and testing out those ideas in real life</strong>. some of the
techniques? they actually work wonders in human interactions—it's
fascinating.</p>
<p>rereading has been a refreshing way to catch details i might have
missed the first time. it's funny how information can just slip through
ur mind without u even noticing, so a good review always feels
worthwhile. 📝</p>

<p>this week, i felt super productive at work, managing to wrap up most
of my tasks right on time or even ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>each day had a familiar rhythm—get up, commute with a good book,
work, hit the gym, beatbox practice, unwind with some me-time, then
sleep. it may have been routine, but there's a sense of calm in the
consistency.</p>
<p>i also decided to head back to malaysia to spend time with my family.
my mum recently hurt her lower back, and i could feel the urge to be
close, to share some quality time and be there for her. this time with
family, no matter how brief, always feels grounding. ❤️</p>
<p>another bright spot was reconnecting with my friends from secondary
school. these are people who have been part of my journey for years, and
catching up with them brought back so many good memories. seeing them
doing so well made me genuinely happy, and i'm just grateful to have
these friendships still going strong.</p>

AN INCONSISTENT LEADER</h3>
<p>It is impossible to seamlessly blend into a team as a jigsaw piece
unless you comprehend the unique shape of each of your team members. Sir
Alex Ferguson's acumen in this regard was legendary, as attested to by
his former players and staff, and even rival managers. He possessed an
encyclopedic knowledge of everything from the hobbies of his players'
wives to the names of their pets, and as Rio Ferdinand told me, even
their grandfathers' preferred brand of whisky. More significantly, he
knew that every member of his team was propelled by vastly different
motivators. While one player may have thrived under Ferguson's infamous
‘hairdryer' treatment (where he would shout angrily at them in the
dressing room or on the training ground), another may have required a
more compassionate approach, and still another may have been motivated
by a more hands-off approach. This is why Ferguson didn't have to be the
tactical mastermind that many assume he must have been, but rather an
emotional savant. When you're in the business of motivating people,
<strong>emotional management is everything.</strong></p>

<p>Great leaders are fluid, flexible, and full of fluctuation. They are
whatever shape they need to be, to complete your motivation.</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week, my priorities were on: work, gym and prepping myself for
the beatbox competition i'm planning to participate. to top it off...
6th december is my birthday too! UGH</p>
<p>it's been over 3 years since i last battled, and i can't even begin
to explain how much i miss it—the rush of adrenaline when you're on
stage, the energy from the crowd, and the vibe from all the other
beatboxers. it's not just the competition; it's the whole experience
that i miss so much.</p>
<p>i've been putting in a lot of effort lately, but, to be honest, it
still feels like i could do more... but, balancing everything—work, gym,
and beatboxing—is tough. after a long day at work, it's straight to the
gym, and only after that do i get the time to practise beatboxing. but i
know it's all about mental. the grind never stops, and i have to push
through it.</p>
<p>my biggest challenge right now is breaking out of my usual beats and
trying to create something new. it's been about 20 days of trying, and
i'm still struggling to come up with fresh routines. it's frustrating,
but i know this is the part of the process where many people give up.
this feeling of being stuck—that's the moment when you're on the verge
of a breakthrough. if i can just push past this, i know success is just
around the corner.</p>
<p>i got this. 🙌</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"The sole reason of why people procrastinate is because they're
trying to avoid some form of ‘psyhological discomfort' in their life.
The bigger the task and the less competent we feel about accomplishing
it, the greater the procrastination."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this quote really struck me. i could feel it resonate in my daily
life, especially when it comes to things like hitting the snooze button
in the morning or mindlessly scrolling through 抖音 and instagram reels.
it's like i'm delaying that sense of discomfort, avoiding the challenge
ahead, even though i know it's not helping me in the long run.</p>
<p>i know i am not alone in this, and that gives me a bit of comfort.
but i also know this is a process, one that takes time and
self-awareness. i'm working on it—slowly, but surely. recognising this
psychological discomfort as the root of procrastination is already a
step forward for me. the next step is taking action, even when i don't
feel ready, and learning to push through that initial resistance. it's a
journey of self-discipline and growth.</p>
<p>i'm not perfect—there are still days when i fall into old habits, but
understanding why i procrastinate has shifted my mindset. i've come to
realise that it's not about eliminating procrastination overnight, but
about <strong>improving little by little</strong>, showing up even on
the hard days, and building momentum. one small victory at a time.
🌱</p>
<p>at the end of the day, <strong>progress over perfection</strong> is
what really matters. so, while i might still have moments of distraction
or hesitation, i'm committed to pushing through and becoming the best
version of myself, one day at a time.</p>
