<p>what a productive week at work! 🥰</p>
<p>i finally released the feature that i conducted UAT for last year in
beijing, and honestly, what an indescribable feeling of seeing it go
live without a critical bug? OK TOUCH WOOD... 😳 <strong>it's moments
like these that remind me why i love what i do</strong>—everything just
feels worth it. very good progress overall, and i couldn't be happier!
🥰💪🏼</p>
<p>another win this week was making strides in improving my
communication skills. i've been focusing on active listening and giving
others the space to share their thoughts, and it's been so rewarding. i
also had a lovely lunch with a colleague from another team at paris
baguette—my virgin try! the food was really nice, and the company made
it even better.</p>
<p>on the fitness front, i managed to push myself to a real to-failure
leg day on friday. but guys, did it hit hard... the soreness was real by
saturday, just in time for my trip to JB for chinese new year
celebrations. 🥲 and, of course, life had a little twist waiting for
me—while walking after tapping out of the mrt, i got the worst cramp in
my right calf muscle. it was so painful i had to stop walking and lean
against the wall with my eyes closed, trying to recover.</p>
<p>as i stood there, i sensed someone looking at me. when i opened my
eyes, i saw this guy staring at me, his expression full of concern. he
raised his hand, clearly wanting to help. i shook my head and gave him
an "OK" 👌🏼 sign, reassuring him i was fine. even as he walked away, he
kept turning back to check on me. it's these little acts of kindness
that restore your faith in humanity and leave a lasting impression. that
stranger? he made my day, and i'll always remember his kindness. 🥹</p>
<p>it reminded me that even the smallest acts can mean so much to
someone, so i'll be sure to double it, and pass it on to the next person
whenever i can. 🌟</p>

<p>i haven't been so busy for quite a while, damn, it was such a
productive week! a few nights, i stayed up alone in the office, pouring
in some extra effort just to complete things. one of the biggest
accomplishments was finishing my self-review for 2024. writing down
reflections on each project i worked on really made me pause and think
deeply.</p>
<p>while writing my self-review on key outputs, i realised how much i've
participated in, but at the same time, i can't help but feel like i
could have done more. it wasn't about slacking off, but how some tasks
seemed almost too easy compared to my past experiences. don't get me
wrong though—what i mean by "easy" is that it was less challenging in
terms of technical knowledge.</p>
<p>thinking back to project H (let's keep it hashed for
confidentiality), i remember how overwhelming it was at the start. the
requirements were straightforward when i look at them now, but back
then? oh boy, it was another story entirely. the business chinese
jargon? it felt like my brain hit a complete blank.</p>
<p>as someone raised in malaysia, speaking chinese, switching to malay
in secondary school, and then studying in singapore for three years
before settling here for over seven... let's just say my language system
got a serious workout. juggling those languages while trying to grasp
the project requirements? yeah, it was intense. i felt so out of my
depth.</p>
<p>when i look back at it now, (yes, i'm smiling 🥹), jinghui, you’ve
come so far. you did so well! even those late nights staying up until
4am, panicking about whether you'd make the deadline... you still made
it. all the mistakes you made during each project? they're the reason
you are where you are today.</p>
<p>that realisation hit me deeply this week. it's moments like these
that remind me of why i push myself—to grow, to overcome, and to keep
building my confidence.</p>

<p>this week i made a conscious effort to be more productive at work-not
just to compensate for the time spent on my beijing trip, but also to
challenge myself. i wanted to prove that with the right mindset, i could
push my limits and achieve so much more. it's all about mental
resilience. at work, i've been handling a requirement with manageable
complexity, but it demands a critical focus on detail. as part of my
goal this year, i'm striving to do things <strong>well</strong>, not
just get them done. it's about adopting the mindset of <a
href="/goals-2025#:~:text=Done%20vs%20Done%20Well">Done vs Done
Well</a>, and this task is no exception. i've been taking my time,
ensuring that the quality of my work aligns with that principle. it's
been challenging, but i'm enjoying the process of learning and growing
in this area. 🎯</p>
<p>as for the weekend, it was nothing short of amazing! i had the chance
to gather with my relatives for an earlier Lo Hey (捞鱼生) @ <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://g.co/kgs/egQyvhv">TungLok Peking Duck Novena</a>! it felt
so good to reconnect with them after such a long time, and it was a
great way to kick off the lunar new year celebrations! 🧧 on top of
that, it happened to be my aunty's birthday (肥肥妈妈). i surprised her
with a cake, and the restaraunt went extra mile-they presented the cake
on a large plate with dry ice underneath, creating an amazing fog
effect. to top it off, they played some chinese EDM birthday songs,
adding to the festive vibe HAHA! loved it so much, it was such a fun and
heartwarming moment. big up to 同乐 for making the celebration so
special!</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">Reading Insights</h2>
<p>as i have been kind of like relearning from the book of <a
href="/never-split-the-difference-by-chris-voss/">Never Split the
Differences by Chris Voss</a>, i have been trying to revise and apply
some of the negotiation tactics in my daily life. it's been quite
interesting to see how these strategies can be used in various
situations, not just in business or high-stakes scenarios. i'm still
working on mastering the art of tactical empathy and calibrated "no,"
but i'm excited to see how these skills evolve over time. 📚</p>
<p>i have been utilising these methods in my conversations with
colleagues and friends, and it's been fascinating to observe the subtle
shifts in dynamics and outcomes. i'm also trying to be more mindful of
my body language and tone of voice, as these non-verbal cues play a
significant role in communication. it's a work in progress, but i'm
enjoying the process of learning and growing in this area. 💬</p>
<p>SO! i was randomly cleaning up my Spotify's playlist and saw that i
have been following The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett podcast!
which i planned to listen but always forgot to... so i clicked on it and
saw a topic just caught my eye! <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/VHUrdELKjDw?si=6QJh_KsPTkIMvgxP">Body Language
Expert: Stop Using This, It’s Making People Dislike You, So Are These
Subtle Mistakes!</a> and i was like, "ok, that sounds interesting!" so i
clicked on it and started listening to it. it was quite an insightful
episode, and i learned a lot about the importance of body language in
communication, she called it the language of cues. i've always been
fascinated by the power of non-verbal cues, and this podcast episode
reinforced the idea that our body language can speak volumes about our
thoughts and emotions. it's a reminder to be more aware of how i present
myself in different situations and how i can use body language to
enhance my communication skills at work and in my personal life!</p>

<p>the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparation
for the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijing
trip, i was a bit behind on the crew's routines and didn't get a chance
to practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so i
put in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, we
pulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks were
lovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of the
team and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and we
really really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉</p>
<p>even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gym
time—because dedication doesn't take a break! the rest of the week was
about catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of work
and gym.</p>
<p>i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7
days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a new
protein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to a
late-night mcd's supper—it's all about balance, right? 🙊</p>
<p>overall, it was a short but fulfilling week, blending beatboxing,
fitness, and a bit of relaxation. can't wait to see what the next week
brings!</p>

          <p>"Never Split the Difference" is a book by Chris Voss, a former FBI
hostage negotiator, that offers negotiation advice you can use in daily
life. The book is centered around the idea that traditional negotiation
strategies, like "splitting the difference," are often ineffective. Voss
provides a range of psychological strategies and tactics to use in
negotiations, derived from his experience in dealing with criminals,
terrorists, and other high-stakes situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Life is negotiation.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key concepts from the book include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mirroring</strong>: Mimicking the other person's language
and behavior to build rapport.</li>
<li><strong>Labeling</strong>: Verbally acknowledging the other person's
situation, feelings, or viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>The "Accusation Audit"</strong>: Preemptively addressing all
of the other party's potential accusations and concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Tactical Empathy</strong>: Understanding the feelings and
mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those
feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that
follow.</li>
<li><strong>The "Calibrated 'No'"</strong>: Saying "No" in a way that
invites more discussion, as opposed to shutting it down.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining Strategies</strong>: Like setting an "Anchor
Price" or using odd numbers to make a price seem more exact.</li>
<li><strong>The "Black Swan" Rule</strong>: The idea that there are
unknown, unpredictable elements in every negotiation that can be used to
your advantage.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-new-rules">Chapter 1: The New Rules</h2>
<p>The majority of the interactions we have at work and at home are
negotiations that boil down to the expression of a simple, animalistic
urge: <strong>I want</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want you to free the hostages,” is a very relevant one to this
book, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But so is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want you to accept that $1 million contract.”</p>
<p>“I want to pay $20,000 for that car.”</p>
<p>“I want you to give me a 10 percent raise.” and</p>
<p>“I want you to go to sleep at 9 p.m.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions—information
gathering and behaviour influencing—and includes almost any interaction
where each party wants something from the other side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was employing what had become one of the FBI’s most potent
negotiating tools: the open-ended question. Today, after some years
evolving these tactics for the private sector in my consultancy, The
Black Swan Group, we call this tactic calibrated questions: queries that
the other side can respond to but that have no fixed answers. It buys
you time. <u>It gives your counterpart the illusion of control—they are
the one with the answers and power after all—and it does all that
without giving them any idea of how constrained they are by it.</u>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psychotherapy research shows that <u>when individuals feel listened
to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly
evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.</u> In addition,
they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to
listen to other points of view, which gets them to the calm and logical
place where they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers.</p>
<p>Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you want
from—and with—other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable
in all relationships. So it’s useful—crucial, even—to know how to engage
in that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get
over your aversion to negotiating. You don’t need to like it; you just
need to understand that’s how the world works. <u>Negotiating does not
mean browbeating or grinding someone down. It simply means playing the
emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get
what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly. So claim your
prerogative to ask for what you think is right.</u></p>
<p>What this book is really about, then, is getting you to accept
negotiation and in doing so learn how to get what you want in a
psychologically aware way. You’ll learn to use your emotions, instincts,
and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influence
them, and achieve more.</p>
<p>Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge
in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their
sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you
want.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chapter-2-be-a-mirror">Chapter 2: Be A Mirror</h2>
<h3 id="assumption-blinds-hypothesis-guide">Assumption blinds,
hypothesis guide</h3>
<p>Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible
surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the
surprises they are certain exist.</p>
<p>In negotiation, each new psychological insight or additional piece of
information revealed heralds a step forward and allows one to discard
one hypothesis in favor of another. You should engage the process with a
mindset of discovery. Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe
as much information as possible. Which, by the way, is one of the
reasons that really smart people often have trouble being
negotiators—they’re so smart they think they don’t have anything to
discover.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“until you know what you’re dealing with, you don’t know what you’re
dealing with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="calm-the-schizophrenic">Calm the Schizophrenic</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia: everyone just listening to the voice in their
head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“to avoid this, we need to apply true active listening which will
disarm the other party and make them feel heard, safe and
understood.“</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Smile at someone on the street, and as a reflex they’ll smile back.
Understanding that reflex and putting it into practice is critical to
the success of just about every negotiating skill there is to
learn.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h3>
<p><u>Mirroring, also called isopraxism</u>, is essentially imitation.
It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which
we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech
patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice. It’s
generally an unconscious behavior—we are rarely aware of it when it’s
happening—but it’s a sign that people are bonding, in sync, and
<u>establishing the kind of rapport that leads to trust.</u></p>
<p>It’s a phenomenon (and now technique) that follows a very basic but
profound biological principle: <u>We fear what’s different and are drawn
to what’s similar.</u>”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“mirror” is when you <u>repeat the last three words (or the critical
one to three words) of what someone has just said</u>. Of the entirety
of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one
gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.</p>
<p>By repeating back what people say, you trigger this mirroring
instinct and your counterpart <u>will inevitably elaborate on what was
just said and sustain the process of connecting</u>. Psychologist
Richard Wiseman created a study using waiters to identify what was the
more effective method of creating a connection with strangers: mirroring
or positive reinforcement.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and usually they will not repeat the same thing again, but will
elaborate on it. This is the key to getting more information from the
other party.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-confront-and-get-your-way-without-confrontation">How to
Confront-And Get Your Way-Without Confrontation</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Use the late-night FM DJ voice.</li>
<li>Start with “I’m sorry . . .”</li>
<li>Mirror.</li>
<li>Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on
your counterpart.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="key-lessons">Key lessons</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible
surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the
surprises she is certain to find.</li>
<li>Don’t commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses and
use the negotiation to test them rigorously.</li>
<li>People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become
overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of
battle; it’s a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much
information as possible.</li>
<li>To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and
all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.</li>
<li>Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all
negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people
can feel as if they’re not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport
and trust you’ve built.</li>
<li>Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of
mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and
problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental
agility in both you and your counterpart.</li>
<li>Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one
to three words) of what someone has just said. We fear what’s different
and are drawn to what’s similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating
similarity, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the
other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your
side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their
strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-voice-tones-available-to-negotiators">Three Voice Tones
Available to Negotiators</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>The late-night FM DJ voice</strong>: Use selectively to make
a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When
done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness
without triggering defensiveness.</li>
<li><strong>The positive/playful voice</strong>: Should be your default
voice. It’s the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person. Your
attitude is light and encouraging. The key here is to relax and smile
while you’re talking.</li>
<li><strong>The direct or assertive voice</strong>: Used rarely. Will
cause problems and create pushback.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="chapter-3-dont-feel-their-pain-label-it">Chapter 3: Don't Feel
Their Pain, Label It</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“How can you separate people from the problem when their emotions are
the problem?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tactical-empathy">Tactical Empathy</h3>
<p>Empathy is the ability to recognise the perspective of a counterpart,
and the vocalisation of that recognition</p>
<p>Tactical empathy is <u>understanding the feelings and mindset of
another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings</u>
so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow.</p>
<p>Empathy is a classic “soft” communication skill, but it has a
physical basis. When we closely observe a person’s face, gestures, and
tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called
neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and
feel.</p>
<p>Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It’s
about understanding them. Empathy helps us learn the position the enemy
is in, why their actions make sense (to them), and what might move
them.</p>
<h3 id="labelling">Labelling</h3>
<p>Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging
it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how
that person feels. It gets you close to someone without asking about
external factors you know nothing about (“How’s your family?”). Think of
labeling as a shortcut to intimacy, a time-saving emotional hack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Labeling has a special advantage when your counterpart is tense.
Exposing negative thoughts to daylight—“It looks like you don’t want to
go back to jail”—makes them seem less frightening.</p>
<p>In one brain imaging study,2 psychology professor Matthew Lieberman
of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that when people are
shown photos of faces expressing strong emotion, the brain shows greater
activity in the amygdala, the part that generates fear. But when they
are asked to label the emotion, the activity moves to the areas that
govern rational thinking. In other words, labeling an emotion—applying
rational words to a fear—disrupts its raw intensity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Label methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It seems like...</li>
<li>It sounds like...</li>
<li>It looks like...</li>
</ol>
<p>The last rule of labeling is <u>silence</u>. Once you’ve thrown out a
label, be quiet and listen. We all have a tendency to expand on what
we’ve said, to finish, “It seems like you like the way that shirt
looks,” with a specific question like “Where did you get it?” But a
label’s power is that it invites the other person to reveal
himself.”</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>i lost my voice the very day i planned to record the voices beatbox
wildcard. it was like universe was playing a cruel joke on me.</p>
<p>honestly, my routine wasn't 100% ready, but losing my voice made
everything feel worse... 😔 i still don't know what caused it, but it
was the first time in my life that i almost completely lost my
voice.</p>
<p>so, instead of giving up, i threw together a freestyle beat in the
office-a routine i literally came up with in like an hour... i recorded
it, posted it, and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>unfortunately, my impromptu routine didn't pass the wildcard
selection. and yeah, i was so mad at myself. 😤 firstly, i could've
prepared and recorded earlier instead of leaving it until the last
minute; secondly, i knew deep down that i didn't put in the effort i
should've. i'm really disappointed in myself, but i also know this is a
lesson to carry forward. 🥺😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">Reading Insights</h2>
<p>this week, i fully immersed myself in Atomic Habits by James Clear.
as i delved into it, i realised just how much the ideas resonate with
me. some of the principles, like focusing on small changes, are things
i've unconsciously applied in my life. but this book made me aware of
how i can refine and strengthen those actions to create a more effective
"system" for myself. it's genuinely inspiring and i can already feel it
reshaping my mindset.</p>
<p>here are some key highlights from Chapter 1 that struck a chord with
me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable—sometimes it
isn't even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in
the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is
astounding. Here's how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent
better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by
the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day
for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small
win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.”</p></li>
<li><p>“a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a
very different destination.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your
future self.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major
change.”</p></li>
<li><p>“habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's
frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere.
It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes
are delayed.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time
thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your
systems.”</p></li>
<li><p>“We think we need to change our results, but the results are not
the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause
those results.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall
in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait
to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime
your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different
forms, not just the one you first envision.”</p></li>
<li><p>“The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process
that will determine your progress.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</li>
<li>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against
you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li>
<li>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding
process are delayed. You need to be patient.</li>
<li>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>it's really all about the systems—this line hit me the hardest: you
do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your
systems. looking at my own life, i realise how much my systems need
improvement, and i feel motivated to start making these 1% changes, even
if they seem small right now.</p>

<p>i went on a trip to China for the first time! omg, i don't know where
to start... it was amazing. honestly, i don't think i can put in into
words, ok, so i'll let the pictures do the talking this time. pictures
speak a thousand words, right? 🥹</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i will just attach some of my favourite pictures later~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on a less cheerful note, i came back with a really really bad sore
throat back that i completely lost my voice halfway through the day at
work. 😭 thank god for the clinic right next to our office that's
covered by insurance-it was so convenient. i literally just gave em my
name, talked to the doc, grabbed my meds and left.</p>
<p>the doc gave me 2 days of mc, but i still went to work the next day.
idk, maybe i was just feeling guilty about taking a day off, but
honestly, my body was sreaming at me to rest. so the day after, i
finally listened. ended up sleeping for 11 hours straight... and omg,
that was the rest i needed! felt so much better afterwards! FULL
RECHARGED! 🔋</p>
<p>but my voice still... and my beatbox competition is approaching
😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">Reading Insights</h2>
<p>AND i finally started reading <strong>Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;
Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones by James
Clear</strong>! it's been on my reading list for ages, and i am so
excited to dive into it. just flipping through the first few pages has
already given me a glimpse of how impactful this book could be for
making lasting changes. i can't wait to apply these principles to my
daily life!</p>

<p>this week was intense... a full 7/7 work grind 😔 by friday nightm i
was so wiped out that i just passed out like that and slept for more
than 9 hours straight! woke up and barely had time to catch my breath
before rushing off to work again.</p>
<p>even though it was hectic, i found a bit of thrill in the unknown
challenges and a sense of satisfaction in pushing through. 🎯💪🏼🔥</p>
<p>AND guess what! F26 canteen is gonna reopen next week! OMG finally!
😭🤞🏼</p>
<p>for my beatboxing practice, with 25 days until the comp and 14 days
left to finish my wildcard, i'm giving it my all. i'm trusting the
process, feeling like i'm hitting a low right before the climb. it's
that moment when u're going down the hill, but i'm so ready to rise any
time! 🔥</p>
<p>watch me.</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">Reading Insights</h2>
<p>i have been revisiting the book <em>Never Split the Difference</em>
by Christopher Voss, a book that's almost become a life strategy guide
for me. i know relying heavily on one book isn't ideal, but i find
myself <strong>taking the parts that resonate, filtering what feels
right, and testing out those ideas in real life</strong>. some of the
techniques? they actually work wonders in human interactions—it's
fascinating.</p>
<p>rereading has been a refreshing way to catch details i might have
missed the first time. it's funny how information can just slip through
ur mind without u even noticing, so a good review always feels
worthwhile. 📝</p>

<p>this week, i felt super productive at work, managing to wrap up most
of my tasks right on time or even ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>each day had a familiar rhythm—get up, commute with a good book,
work, hit the gym, beatbox practice, unwind with some me-time, then
sleep. it may have been routine, but there's a sense of calm in the
consistency.</p>
<p>i also decided to head back to malaysia to spend time with my family.
my mum recently hurt her lower back, and i could feel the urge to be
close, to share some quality time and be there for her. this time with
family, no matter how brief, always feels grounding. ❤️</p>
<p>another bright spot was reconnecting with my friends from secondary
school. these are people who have been part of my journey for years, and
catching up with them brought back so many good memories. seeing them
doing so well made me genuinely happy, and i'm just grateful to have
these friendships still going strong.</p>
<p>普普通通 平平淡淡的一周</p>
<p>但是又觉得很充实 💪🏼</p>

POWER OF PROGRESS</h3>
<p>To solve problems, encourage and celebrate small wins. This provides
continuous forward momentum, which creates an atmosphere of success and
a positive sense that a team is moving towards their bigger goals.
Employees are most motivated when they are engaged with the work that
they're doing, and feel like they are making a difference.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most professionally rewarding feeling in the world is a sense of
forward motion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-law-you-must-be-an-inconsistent-leader">THE LAW: YOU MUST BE
AN INCONSISTENT LEADER</h3>
<p>It is impossible to seamlessly blend into a team as a jigsaw piece
unless you comprehend the unique shape of each of your team members. Sir
Alex Ferguson's acumen in this regard was legendary, as attested to by
his former players and staff, and even rival managers. He possessed an
encyclopedic knowledge of everything from the hobbies of his players'
wives to the names of their pets, and as Rio Ferdinand told me, even
their grandfathers' preferred brand of whisky. More significantly, he
knew that every member of his team was propelled by vastly different
motivators. While one player may have thrived under Ferguson's infamous
‘hairdryer' treatment (where he would shout angrily at them in the
dressing room or on the training ground), another may have required a
more compassionate approach, and still another may have been motivated
by a more hands-off approach. This is why Ferguson didn't have to be the
tactical mastermind that many assume he must have been, but rather an
emotional savant. When you're in the business of motivating people,
<strong>emotional management is everything.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great leaders are fluid, flexible, and full of fluctuation. They are
whatever shape they need to be, to complete your motivation.</p>
