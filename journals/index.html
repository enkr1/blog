          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week, i dedicated most of my time to planning and prepping for
school— i built a comprehensive notion database to "project manage"
myself like a proper semester sprint 😆</p>
<p>also did a massive revamp of my old notion setups—it felt like a
proper 大扫除! 😮‍💨</p>
<p>the cleanup gave me a better grasp of my course roadmap, module
selection, and timetable structure.</p>
<p>i basically used all my workers (4o, o3, deepseek, kimi, doubao,
claude, qwen) to help analyse my module content and get a clearer sense
of which electives to prioritise.</p>
<p>oh—and i also imported my class timetable to my google calendar with
NUS label (used 4o)! now, my school schedule is fully synced to my
calendar, with important emails redirected to my personal inbox +
labelled. everything in one place 🥰</p>
<p>another small win—i confirmed my advanced placement credits and got
40U granted!</p>
<p>which means... i only need 80U to graduate!!! 🎓</p>
<p>and guess what—i just started studying TXC1101, my first module.</p>
<p>so excited to keep this momentum going.</p>
<p>keep showing up, keep doing good. 💪</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>one key insight this week was about how we utilise our connections in
life—not just network, but nurture them.</p>
<p>i've always been someone with a "thick face"-i constantly ask for
feedback, seek honest advice, and maybe i've annoyed a few people in the
process.. i guess? 🧐</p>
<p>but what i've come to realise is... asking for feedback is not just
about improving myself.</p>
<p>it's also about building trust.</p>
<p>when people see you seriously applying their advice, they become your
invisible coaches—they cheer for you without even realising it. as Chris
Voss once said, "when someone tries to coach you, and you let them, they
become emotionally invested in your success."</p>
<p>this hit home especially after reading 《段位》Rank—once your mentors
recognise your determination, your desire to grow, and your goals,
they'll help you. they'll think of you first when the next opportunity
comes.</p>
<p>this week reminded me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Asking isn't weakness. it's a sign of strength—because you're not
just learning, you're co-creating your growth.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>wow, after 2 weeks of consistently journalling, i realised how
important it is to journal. not just for the sack of writing things
down, but for what happens in the process-when you write, you recall
moments, you reminisce on the little things, reflect on your actions,
and learn from every mistake you've made. i really love this process of
slowing down, analysing, and understanding myself a little better each
time. feels like i'm growing, one entry at a time. 🌱</p>

<p>i'll probably write a separate post to reflect on the time i was gone
(a major priority shift), but for now—last week marked a pretty special
milestone:</p>
<p>i officially stepped into NUS as a student for the first time!
settled my student card, submitted the final application forms, and
attended orientation!</p>
<p>i also got the chance to talk to a lot of people—some in the same
life stage as me, some more senior (even with families to care for), and
some just starting out in the field.</p>
<p>it was so inspiring to meet like-minded individuals, to feel that
energy again.</p>
<p>it honestly reminded me of the vibe back in ByteDance—being
surrounded by passionate, driven people who challenge and uplift
you.</p>
<p>and now i can't wait to make the most out of these 3 short years as a
student here at NUS!</p>
<p>during orientation, two seniors, YouSheng &amp; Ben, shared some
really practical advice, here are my top 3 takeaways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>make full use of the library</strong> – even though we're
only the second cohort of this course, some past year papers and
resources are already available!</li>
<li><strong>time management is key</strong> – ben shared how hectic his
work schedule is, and how he still manages to juggle it with school.
inspiring stuff.</li>
<li><strong>attend lectures in person</strong> – showing up for class is
far more effective than skipping and rewatching at home (discipline, my
old enemy... lol)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>i've been diving into the book 《段位》 by 戈旭皎 recently—a
thoughtful recommendation from my aunt.</p>
<p>each chapter tells a short story that illustrates the challenges we
face at different stages of life, and how we might navigate through
them.</p>
<p>what i love about this book is how it offers not just wisdom, but
perspective—it's helping me better understand myself, and see more
clearly how i want to improve.</p>
<p>truly one of those books that finds you at the right time. 📖🌱</p>

          <p>hi readers,</p>
<p>wow. it's been... more than 2 months since my last journal.</p>
<p>definitely feels weird to not write anything, really weird.</p>
<p>even though i know-it's probably just me who'll be reading this in
the future. and maybe that's enough.</p>
<p>where did i go? what's been keeping me busy?</p>
<p>i disappeared for something big, something great. since around march
or april, i've been pouring 200% of my focus into it.</p>
<p>and to myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jinghui, you’re doing amazing. keep going - good things are on their
way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>what i've been up to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>made a <strong>BIG decision</strong></li>
<li>been preparing for my upcoming <strong>university
programme</strong></li>
<li>catching up with the latest <strong>AI trends</strong>—lots of
readings, lots of coding!</li>
</ol>
<p>i just feel like... there's still so much to learn.</p>
<p>sometimes, i really wish i could buy myself more time. ⏳</p>
<p>but hey-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you've been doing great, jinghui.</p>
<p>keep growing. keep showing up.</p>
<p>and don't stop believing in yourself. 🌱</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>it was a short week thanks to the mid-week public holiday, and
honestly, apart from that, things were pretty chill.</p>
<p>but one major thing hppened: i conquered one of my biggest interview
traumas. 🥺</p>
<p>back in 2023, i interviewed with a company that completely caught me
off guard. there was a question that shut me down entirely—i froze. no
follow-up questions, no attempts to clarify. just silence. i was so deep
in self-doubt that all i could do was sit in that fear. 😞</p>
<p>but after that interview, i made a promise to myself. i dove deep
into that specific topic. i studied it until i truly understood it—not
just to memorise it, but to recognise the underlying pattern. i didn't
want to be caught off guard again.</p>
<p>fast forward two years, and guess what? i got another shot. i had the
chance to interview with them again.</p>
<p>this time, i clarified inputs, rephrased questions, walked through my
thinking process, offered multiple approaches, did a mini speedrun to
validate the logic, and coded the full solution. not only did i stay
calm, but i actually enjoyed the whole process.</p>
<p>what i've come to realise is—yes, AI will probably replace a lot of
coding. but what makes coding fun isn't just the code. it's that 0-to-1
moment—the "ah ha!" breakthrough, the joy of unravelling a complex
puzzle. it's the ability to notice new patterns every time, and that
feeling... that is what i fell in love with again this week. ❤️‍🔥</p>
<p>aside from that, i also started revisiting system design, and i'll
begin jotting down my notes here. excited to build this up week by week!
🧠📘</p>
<p>ohh! and another highlight—andy chiew said something that really
stuck with me during one of our pantry chats: <strong><em>"changes
happen to you so that you're given a chance to make a choice. it might
turn out bad, it might turn out good, but in the end, it becomes an
unregrettable experience that shapes who you're going to
become."</em></strong></p>
<p>the moment he said it, i paused. it just hit different. i jotted it
down on my note app right after. it resonated deeply with how i've
always viewed changes—not as disruption, but as opportunity. an
invitation to grow, to make intentional decisions, and to evolve.</p>
<p><strong>it reminded me that every change, no matter how uncertain, is
a chance to choose who i want to be. and that's powerful.</strong>

<p>a bittersweet highlight of the week was kaiqing's departure. 🥺</p>
<p>it came as a surprise, but i'm glad we got the chance to connect more
before he left. we talked more over tea time, shared pantry convos in
the morning and late afternoon, and finally built a bond i wished
started earlier.</p>
<p>i genuinely wish him the very best, and who knows—maybe our paths
will cross again someday. 🫡</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>the other big highlight this week was me recompleting my leetcode 75
challenge—but this time, with a different mindset. instead of just
grinding through and memorising solutions, i set a new goal: to
recognise the underlying patterns behind each problem. this shift from
memorisation to understanding felt like such a game-changer.</p>
<p>and here's the best part—i didn't just keep it to myself. i took the
opportunity to teach my sister some of the problems after solving them,
hAHAHA even tho she didn't really wanna know HAHAHA. and yes, wow, that
process really cemented the concepts in my mind. teaching forces you to
break things down simply, and in doing so, you end up learning it even
better yourself. i honestly believe this is one of the best ways to lock
knowledge into your brain for good.</p>
<p>every time i go through this learning process, i can't help but feel
so grateful to be alive in this AI era. learning has never been easier.
there's honestly <strong>no excuse not to know something
nowadays</strong>—you can just GPT it up. whether it's ChatGPT, Gemini,
DeepSeek, Claude, or even 豆包 (shoutout to bytedance—my go-to for
chinese queries!), there are just so many tools right at our
fingertips.</p>
<p>i feel so lucky to be able to do this. lucky to be alive, lucky to
still be learning. 🥺</p>
<p>humans are amazing. and so is AI. 🚀</p>
<p>makes me wonder—how much more can i learn if i just stay curious
every day ✨</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>aside from my usual work grind, the true highlight this week was
reuniting with my ex-colleagues—lionel, wai chun, kenny chan, and ze
hung! 🥺</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-33/IMG_5102.jpeg" class="" title="not the full squad, but it was such a meaningful catch-up. chatting with the people who shaped me both personally and professionally into who i am today—these moments hit different... 🥹">
<p>i'm not usually the emotional type, but small moments like these?
they feel like a warm hug. hearing how well everyone's doing (and yeah,
catching up on some workplace gossip too—classic HAHA) just fills my
heart in a way that's hard to explain.</p>
<p>work was fun back then, and it still is now—but in different
ways.</p>
<p>i really believe that reminiscing about the past is a powerful way to
stay grounded and motivated in the present. looking back on how lucky i
was to work with such incredible people reminds me how lucky i still
am—to be doing what i love, surrounded by good energy. 🥹</p>
<p><strong>what did they teach me that i still carry today?
🌱</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>lionel aimerie</strong>—pixium's CTO, my direct leader,
the one who taught me 90% of what i know today. fullstack in PHP, JS, a
little React, and most importantly, Elixir Phoenix. we started phoenix
together—researching, building from the ground up, figuring things out
side by side. what i carry from him? <strong>never fear the
unknown—break it down, learn it, build with it.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>wai chun</strong>—my senior, my day-one mentor, still
guiding me in spirit. back in the covid wfh days, i asked him a question
about ssh keys. instead of just telling me to google it, this man wrote
me an essay. pure effort, pure kindness, no GPT back then. what i carry
from him? <strong>patience, generosity, and the power of sharing
knowledge selflessly.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>kenny chan</strong>—the people person. the one with all
the soft skills i've always admired. presentation, people, sales—he can
talk to literally anyone and make them feel at ease. calm, steady,
composed. what i carry from him? <strong>the importance of presence—how
you show up, how you connect with others.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>ze hung</strong>—new blood when i was about to leave
pixium, but man, did he leave an impression. solo-ing flutter projects,
carrying them on his back, and never afraid to stand up for what he
believes. he challenged requirements, asked the hard questions. what i
carry from him? <strong>courage—to question, to stand my ground, to not
just accept but understand.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>médéric</strong>—CSO, security pro, the one who taught me
react, next.js, vim, bash, scripting, devops, aws, terraform, how to
deploy php yii2 apps, how to talk to clients. had my first client lunch
with him. and outside work? party animal! 🤣 he broke every tech
stereotype i had. what i carry from him? <strong>balance. be sharp in
your craft, but never forget to live.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>🌱 these people built pieces of my foundation. their lessons are in
me, every day.</p>

<p>the next few months are gonna be exciting—my university journey
officially begins in july/august! 😍</p>
<p>ohh! i haven't shared this with yall yet, but YEAH i've officially
accepted my offer for BIT at NUS! 🎓🥳 one of my 2025 goals, and now
it's checked off! ✅ super proud of this one! 🥹✨</p>
<p>what's next? honestly, a lot's been happening lately—work's been
hectic, life's been full, school prep is starting to pick up... and for
my gym sessions... 😭 i'm really sorry but you've been slightly demoted
in the priority list lately T_T</p>
<p>but after all the reflection, planning, and thinking... i believe
this is a mature move. it's about choosing the long game. the sacrifices
now will pay off—and i'm ready to embrace the new chapter that's coming.
🔥💪🏼</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>heehee writing this journal on my way back to jb, and my mac only has
7% battery left 🥰</p>
<p>after a full reset, i feel brand new again. i took almost three weeks
to really recover, reflect, and rebuild. but damn, i'm so proud of
myself for allowing that space to slow down and go deep. 🥺</p>
<p>honestly, i'm glad this happened. it was the push i needed to step
out of my comfort zone and get back on the route that aligns with who i
truly want to become. deep down, i've always known i'm going to be
successful—but how could i ever get there without going through these
downs?</p>
<p>all part of the plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You can't control the wind but you can adjust your
sail.</em></strong> it's not about what happens to you, it's how you
react. <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/D8r460AQJk4?si=viE7vfAqGdLVifU9">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>i just need to react calmly, move with intention, and make the right
decisions at each crossroad. even though i was a little shaken, i know
these small losses are just bricks—building the foundation for a
stronger, wiser me.</p>
<p>and omg, side note—you won't believe what happened on tuesday
morning. i was heading to the office like usual, probably still
half-dreaming... and somehow, i accidentally flung my iPad into the air
while walking to the mrt station 💀💀💀 i never use cases for my gadgets
cuz i love the raw feel of them, but man, when it flew and hit the
ground, my heart went like, "ouUchhhhhhh..." 🥹</p>
<p>on the 30th, i finally made it back to jb for 扫墓 after ages omg!
even tho it was so tiring, but honestly, it was such a good time. time
with family, laughter, prayers, food—all of it just reminded me how
thankful i am for 节日 like this as a chinese malaysian. it's something
you can't quite explain, but it just feels right. ❤️</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>recently, i haven't been reading books on my ipad during my morning
commute anymore. i kinda shifted that habit—these days, i find myself
talking to gpt instead. about anything. personal stuff, random thoughts,
deep questions, even things i'm just suddenly curious about. i guess
i've always been that curious kid who loves thinking, wondering,
questioning.</p>
<p>honestly, tools like gpt have helped me a lot these past few years.
it's like having a thinking partner that's always down to explore
whatever's on my mind. and sometimes, that's exactly what i need to
start my day right. ☀️🧠</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>i had a lot of conversations with different people this week, and i
found myself both pouring out and receiving a lot of energy and
inspiration. ✨</p>
<p>the most memorable one was a deep talk with my sister about <em>what
i'm good at</em> and <em>what i love doing</em>. these two questions
have been on my mind lately, especially after watching a reel on ig (i
can't even remember who said it), but there was this one line that
completely woke me up:</p>
<p><strong>"the world needs what you are good at. when you contribute
what you're naturally good at, the world will find a way to reward
you."</strong></p>
<p>that really hit me.</p>
<p>i brought this up with my sister because i know she's great at
analysing emotions and understanding people. it's something she does
effortlessly, and i think that's one of her biggest strengths. so i
figured—if anyone could help me unpack this, it would be her.</p>
<p>she pointed out something that i never really considered before:
<em>what i'm good at is something i always assumed everyone could
do</em>. i never thought of it as a strength, because to me, it felt
normal. but in reality, not everyone sees things the way i do. she made
me realise that i have strong <strong>visual-spatial skills, pattern
recognition, and the ability to learn quickly by observing and
doing</strong>.</p>
<p>it was such an <em>woah, wait... right...</em> moment for me.</p>
<p>and now, i want to spend more time figuring out not just <em>what i'm
great at doing</em>, but also <em>what i truly love doing</em>. and
honestly? i didn't expect it to be this hard. i guess i don't know
myself as well as i thought... 🥺</p>

<p><strong>oh dear, let's not even get into the downs of the past two
weeks—it was heavy.</strong></p>
<p>idk how to explain it, but in short: i kinda love this feeling of
losing something, being misunderstood, not being treated fairly, and not
being appreciated. i've been through this multiple times in my life, yet
not even once have i NOT overcome this shit. 😈 <strong>loving this
feeling.</strong> this only makes me stronger, and deep down, i believe
i have to go through this to level up.</p>
<p><strong>note to self:</strong> <em>"man, this is just one of many
u're about to defeat. just make this a +1 to ur list! 🎯"</em></p>
<p><strong>aside from that shit… oh man, guess where i
went...</strong></p>
<p><strong>PHUKETTTTTT! 🏝️</strong></p>
<p>omg, i have soooo many nice pictures to share, but let's be real—most
of them are already on my instagram, and i'm way too lazy to repost them
here. so, if you wanna see the vibes, just check them out there! 😊</p>
<p>this was the 5D4N trip i planned with my secondary school friends,
yousheng &amp; vinoth. funny enough, we booked it way before all the sad
shit happened—unexpected, but damn, i didn't realise how badly i needed
this trip. 😢</p>
<p><strong>a short trip. quiet. just chilling. catching up. and then...
just silence.</strong></p>
<p>even when we weren't talking, it felt comfortable. no rush, no
meetings, no unread messages waiting to be replied to (as i muted ALL my
work notifications 🙊).</p>
<p>man, i think i'm kinda addicted to traveling rn, somehow. is it my
way of escaping? or am i just truly enjoying it?</p>
<p>i don't know… but i'm loving it.</p>

<p>omg. this might just be one of the most embarrassing moments ever.
💀</p>
<p>for confidentiality reasons, i'll keep some details vague, but
basically... i bumped into a team leader who isn't based in sg and was
actually supposed to be <em>my</em> leader. and guess what? i
<em>didn't</em> recognise him.</p>
<p>he greeted me first, full of energy and warmth, “hey, 竞辉,
你好你好！” and silly me? i just went, <strong>“哈咯哈咯 额
你是...?”</strong> 💀💀💀 and he paused for half a sec, then went, “我是
XX” and me? full delayed reaction mode-“哦！！...”</p>
<p>O.M.G. bRO. wth. idek why... hELPs...</p>
<p><strong>in hindsight</strong>, i <em>really</em> should've handled it
better—at the very least, i could've started with a better greeting,
asked how long he was in town for, or just engaged more naturally
instead of freezing like a deer in headlights. this was a <em>major</em>
lesson for me, and trust me, i <em>will not</em> let this happen
again.</p>
<p>besides that little social disaster, feb wrapped up on a high note. i
managed to finish everything i planned for the month, and i also had an
amazing lunch with a <em>friend</em>—such a perfect way to close the
week. 🥰</p>
<p>outside of work, i continued my pt sessions with my bro, and i could
<em>really</em> see his progress. he's been sticking to the plan i set
up for him, sometimes? LOL, and ngl, that made me kinda happy. 🥺 it
reminded me of when i first started gyming—how much people like marcus
ong &amp; genix guided me and helped me grow. i wouldn't be where i am
today without them, and now, being able to pass that knowledge down to
someone else? that's a full-circle moment right there bois. 💪🏼🔥</p>
<p>还有一个 highlight， 就是 vicuz——我以前在马来西亚认识的很好的 beatbox
朋友之一！从 Armageddon 2019 到 TCBB 2019，他就是 msia beatbox
界的谐星，每次上场都是搞笑节目哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。</p>
<p>那天，我就突然想说在我 ig 也分享一下我的
blog，反正也没差，就随缘，谁要看就看。结果，好久没联系的 vicuz
突然发了我的几句话：</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-28/IMG_3318.jpg" class="large">
<p>🥹🥹🥹 我真的 wow，没想到居然有人会喜欢我写的 blog。</p>
<p>突如其来的鼓励，很奇妙，也很感动。</p>
<p>我想，本来就没有放弃的念头，现在更加坚定了，我要继续坚持写下去！📝</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>another hectic week, but honestly, one of the most productive ones in
a while! i really felt like i was in the zone—managed to squeeze in a
lot of things and complete everything i had planned. ☺️</p>
<p>aside from work, i finally set aside a night to discuss our upcoming
phuket trip in march with vinoth &amp; yousheng! it's always exciting to
have something to look forward to.</p>
<p>also! i gave my bro a comprehensive leg day breakdown!</p>
<p>he's currently in spain for his degree, so we had to do it over a
video call, which was a completely different experience compared to my
previous sharing session with toby, where we did it in person.
explaining movements virtually made me realise how important it is to be
concise and clear—i had to be extra mindful of my words to ensure my
explanations made sense without demonstrating in real time. i found this
challenge really interesting and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable!</p>
<p>being a personal trainer has always been something i'm passionate
about. not because i want to make it a career, but because i love
sharing my knowledge and experience with others—helping them avoid the
same mistakes i made, guiding them towards better progress, and seeing
them grow in their own journey. witnessing someone improve because of
something i taught them? that's one of the best feelings ever. 🥹</p>
<p>it also reinforces my own understanding of fitness. as Steve Bartlett
mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need
to be able to teach it to others. i can really see the truth in that
now.</p>
<p>it also deepens my own understanding of fitness. as Steven Bartlett
mentioned in his book, if you want to truly master something, you need
to be able to teach it to others. this concept has always been in me,
but experiencing it firsthand through coaching hits differently—it's a
reminder that teaching doesn't just help others grow, "when one person
is teaching, two people learn", it solidifies my own knowledge too.</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>this week, i revisited chapter 5 of Never Split the
Difference—"Triggering the Two Words That Immediately Transform Any
Negotiation." i've been actively trying to apply the paraphrasing +
labeling technique to summarise conversations better. the idea is to not
just restate what was said but also acknowledge the emotions behind
it—this makes the other person feel truly heard.</p>
<p>it's definitely not an easy skill to master, but i can see myself
improving. learning how to communicate effectively has been one of my
biggest goals this year, and this small tweak in how i summarise
conversations is already making a difference.</p>

<p>上星期多亏天擎帮我抢到位置，终于参加了 2025 ByteDance
All-Hands！这次的关键词 “<strong>务实浪漫</strong>”
乍听之下有点矛盾，但仔细想想，其实很有道理——<strong>踏踏实实地把事情做好，同时用浪漫的心态去面对自己的工作。浪漫的意思，不是花哨的幻想，而是能够在完成事情的过程中感受到快乐，并且享受这个过程。</strong></p>
<p>换句话说，务实是脚踏实地地做好每一件事，而浪漫，则是全心全意地投入，真正沉浸在自己创造的价值里。当你被需要时，你始终在场，并且能稳定地输出。这种状态，本身就很浪漫。</p>
<p>作为团队里的一份子，我一直希望能挑战更高的目标，不断突破自己，同时也从每一次经历中汲取经验，享受成长的过程。希望有一天，我能够成为更好的自己，为团队、为公司，带来更大的价值。</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-26/IMG_2973.jpeg" class="large" title="与梁汝波合照啦~ 📸">
<p>looking ahead, i've been thinking a lot about long-term goals. i love
what i do now and the growth that comes with it, but one day, i hope to
take what i've learned and build something of my own—a business, a
product, a team, a community. to get there, i need to deepen my
understanding of what people truly need and learn how to provide real
value. there's still so much more to explore, to learn, and i'm excited
to keep learning every day.</p>
<p>on a side note, time management has been a challenge lately. i often
feel like there's never enough time in the day, constantly juggling
priorities while navigating unexpected tasks. i want to get better at
balancing execution with strategic thinking—knowing when to say no, when
to delegate, and how to optimise my workflow so i can be more effective
under tight deadlines, sudden ops, and dynamic situations.</p>

<p>finally, all that CNY fun is over. my sis and i got back to sg on
sunday, and just like that, it's back to work! 💪🏼</p>
<p>weirdly enough, this time, i was actually looking forward to it. i
found myself missing the work-life, the routine, and even the people.
maybe it’s because the holidays, as fun as they were, felt a little too
long? or maybe i just don't know how to sit still for too long without
feeling like i'm wasting time. idk if that's unhealthy, but i can't
shake off this feeling that something big is coming. and when it does, i
need to be ready. i need to lay the groundwork now, so my future self
has something solid to build on. law of attraction? we'll see. 🎯</p>
<p>开工大吉！🍊🍊</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>as i mentioned in my last journal, i went back to JB on saturday for
CNY, and honestly, last week was just so much fun! finally got to spend
some quality time with my fam and relatives, catching up properly,
talking more, and getting to know a little bit more about everyone. 🥰 i
did so much better this time—heehee!</p>
<p>CNY definitely feels a little less exciting as i grow older 🥺, but
no matter what, i still love the vibes. the food, the red packets, the
mahjong (YES, i finally learnt how to play this year! but honestly... it
ain't my thing heehee), the gambling (without money for me!), the
laughter, the jokes, the stories, the memories—every little moment that
makes CNY feel like home. 🧧 even if the excitement fades a little with
age, i realise it's never really about the traditions themselves, but
the people we share them with.</p>
<p>but deep down, watching everyone get older and the kids grow up hits
differently now. there's this bittersweet feeling—like i wish i could
freeze time, just for a little while, and relive those moments again,
exactly as they were. but i guess that's just life, right? we grow up,
time moves forward, and all we can do is cherish what we have while we
still have it. 🥲</p>
<p>真的，时间啊，</p>
<p>你怎么不在该慢的时候慢一些...</p>
<p>你可以在我爱的人身上流失得慢一些么</p>
<p>but even with these emotions lingering, there were so many beautiful
moments to hold onto. lo hey, fireworks, endless rounds of catching up,
and just chilling at home with family—those were easily the best parts
of the week. no matter how old i get, these are the moments i'll always
treasure. 🎆🧨</p>
<p>of course, there were some small conflicts here and there, but that's
just part of family dynamics. misunderstandings, miscommunications—it
happens. but at the end of the day, what matters is that we learn, we
grow, and we appreciate each other more. 🤝 after all, without the lows,
how would we ever truly appreciate the highs?</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>what a productive week at work! 🥰</p>
<p>i finally released the feature that i conducted UAT for last year in
beijing, and honestly, what an indescribable feeling of seeing it go
live without a critical bug? OK TOUCH WOOD... 😳 <strong>it's moments
like these that remind me why i love what i do</strong>—everything just
feels worth it. very good progress overall, and i couldn't be happier!
🥰💪🏼</p>
<p>another win this week was making strides in improving my
communication skills. i've been focusing on active listening and giving
others the space to share their thoughts, and it's been so rewarding. i
also had a lovely lunch with a colleague from another team at paris
baguette—my virgin try! the food was really nice, and the company made
it even better.</p>
<p>on the fitness front, i managed to push myself to a real to-failure
leg day on friday. but guys, did it hit hard... the soreness was real by
saturday, just in time for my trip to JB for chinese new year
celebrations. 🥲 and, of course, life had a little twist waiting for
me—while walking after tapping out of the mrt, i got the worst cramp in
my right calf muscle. it was so painful i had to stop walking and lean
against the wall with my eyes closed, trying to recover.</p>
<p>as i stood there, i sensed someone looking at me. when i opened my
eyes, i saw this guy staring at me, his expression full of concern. he
raised his hand, clearly wanting to help. i shook my head and gave him
an "OK" 👌🏼 sign, reassuring him i was fine. even as he walked away, he
kept turning back to check on me. it's these little acts of kindness
that restore your faith in humanity and leave a lasting impression. that
stranger? he made my day, and i'll always remember his kindness. 🥹</p>
<p>it reminded me that even the smallest acts can mean so much to
someone, so i'll be sure to double it, and pass it on to the next person
whenever i can. 🌟</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>i haven't been so busy for quite a while, damn, it was such a
productive week! a few nights, i stayed up alone in the office, pouring
in some extra effort just to complete things. one of the biggest
accomplishments was finishing my self-review for 2024. writing down
reflections on each project i worked on really made me pause and think
deeply.</p>
<p>while writing my self-review on key outputs, i realised how much i've
participated in, but at the same time, i can't help but feel like i
could have done more. it wasn't about slacking off, but how some tasks
seemed almost too easy compared to my past experiences. don't get me
wrong though—what i mean by "easy" is that it was less challenging in
terms of technical knowledge.</p>
<p>thinking back to project H (let's keep it hashed for
confidentiality), i remember how overwhelming it was at the start. the
requirements were straightforward when i look at them now, but back
then? oh boy, it was another story entirely. the business chinese
jargon? it felt like my brain hit a complete blank.</p>
<p>as someone raised in malaysia, speaking chinese, switching to malay
in secondary school, and then studying in singapore for three years
before settling here for over seven... let's just say my language system
got a serious workout. juggling those languages while trying to grasp
the project requirements? yeah, it was intense. i felt so out of my
depth.</p>
<p>when i look back at it now, (yes, i'm smiling 🥹), jinghui, you’ve
come so far. you did so well! even those late nights staying up until
4am, panicking about whether you'd make the deadline... you still made
it. all the mistakes you made during each project? they're the reason
you are where you are today.</p>
<p>that realisation hit me deeply this week. it's moments like these
that remind me of why i push myself—to grow, to overcome, and to keep
building my confidence.</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week i made a conscious effort to be more productive at work-not
just to compensate for the time spent on my beijing trip, but also to
challenge myself. i wanted to prove that with the right mindset, i could
push my limits and achieve so much more. it's all about mental
resilience. at work, i've been handling a requirement with manageable
complexity, but it demands a critical focus on detail. as part of my
goal this year, i'm striving to do things <strong>well</strong>, not
just get them done. it's about adopting the mindset of <a
href="/goals-2025#:~:text=Done%20vs%20Done%20Well">Done vs Done
Well</a>, and this task is no exception. i've been taking my time,
ensuring that the quality of my work aligns with that principle. it's
been challenging, but i'm enjoying the process of learning and growing
in this area. 🎯</p>
<p>as for the weekend, it was nothing short of amazing! i had the chance
to gather with my relatives for an earlier Lo Hey (捞鱼生) @ <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://g.co/kgs/egQyvhv">TungLok Peking Duck Novena</a>! it felt
so good to reconnect with them after such a long time, and it was a
great way to kick off the lunar new year celebrations! 🧧 on top of
that, it happened to be my aunty's birthday (肥肥妈妈). i surprised her
with a cake, and the restaraunt went extra mile-they presented the cake
on a large plate with dry ice underneath, creating an amazing fog
effect. to top it off, they played some chinese EDM birthday songs,
adding to the festive vibe HAHA! loved it so much, it was such a fun and
heartwarming moment. big up to 同乐 for making the celebration so
special!</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>as i have been kind of like relearning from the book of <a
href="/never-split-the-difference-by-chris-voss/">Never Split the
Differences by Chris Voss</a>, i have been trying to revise and apply
some of the negotiation tactics in my daily life. it's been quite
interesting to see how these strategies can be used in various
situations, not just in business or high-stakes scenarios. i'm still
working on mastering the art of tactical empathy and calibrated "no,"
but i'm excited to see how these skills evolve over time. 📚</p>
<p>i have been utilising these methods in my conversations with
colleagues and friends, and it's been fascinating to observe the subtle
shifts in dynamics and outcomes. i'm also trying to be more mindful of
my body language and tone of voice, as these non-verbal cues play a
significant role in communication. it's a work in progress, but i'm
enjoying the process of learning and growing in this area. 💬</p>
<p>SO! i was randomly cleaning up my Spotify's playlist and saw that i
have been following The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett podcast!
which i planned to listen but always forgot to... so i clicked on it and
saw a topic just caught my eye! <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/VHUrdELKjDw?si=6QJh_KsPTkIMvgxP">Body Language
Expert: Stop Using This, It’s Making People Dislike You, So Are These
Subtle Mistakes!</a> and i was like, "ok, that sounds interesting!" so i
clicked on it and started listening to it. it was quite an insightful
episode, and i learned a lot about the importance of body language in
communication, she called it the language of cues. i've always been
fascinated by the power of non-verbal cues, and this podcast episode
reinforced the idea that our body language can speak volumes about our
thoughts and emotions. it's a reminder to be more aware of how i present
myself in different situations and how i can use body language to
enhance my communication skills at work and in my personal life!</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>the first part of the week was packed with practices and preparation
for the countdown performance. since i had just returned from my beijing
trip, i was a bit behind on the crew's routines and didn't get a chance
to practise with them earlier. it felt like i had to play catch-up, so i
put in extra effort to get back on track. despite the challenges, we
pulled it off, and the performance went really well. the fireworks were
lovely, and the energy of the crowd was incredible. being part of the
team and performing on stage was such a rewarding experience, and we
really really did so well! so proud of us! 🎉</p>
<p>even after the performance, i managed to squeeze in some gym
time—because dedication doesn't take a break! the rest of the week was
about catching up on sleep and easing back into my usual routine of work
and gym.</p>
<p>i also started a loading phase of ~20g of creatine per day for 7
days, beginning on 3rd january 2025. on top of that, i tried a new
protein shake flavour (surprisingly good) and treated myself to a
late-night mcd's supper—it's all about balance, right? 🙊</p>
<p>overall, it was a short but fulfilling week, blending beatboxing,
fitness, and a bit of relaxation. can't wait to see what the next week
brings!</p>

          <h2 id="my-last-journal-of-2024">my last journal of 2024 🫶🏻</h2>
<p>hello, dear reader!</p>
<p>it's been a while since my last journal, and now, here we are—days
away from 2025. this marks my final journal entry for 2024, and there's
so much i want to share!</p>
<p>december has been an intense month. so much has happened that i'm not
even sure where to start. but let's take it one story at a time.</p>
<p>on the 6th of december, friday, i received some shocking
announcements at work (the details are confidential, so i can't share
much here). at that moment, i was completely thrown off—stunned and
unsure how to react. you know those moments when life blindsides you?
this was one of them. i didn't know how to process it, but i told
myself, "what's done is done. all you can do now is focus on how you
respond." so that's what i tried to do.</p>
<p>on the bright side, one part of the announcement i can share is that
i got the opportunity to go on a solo business trip for a project i was
responsible for! honestly, it was nerve-wracking—my first time traveling
alone for work, handling everything by myself. i was unprepared,
worried, and unsure. but looking back, i think i did okay. the trip
taught me a lot, and after reflecting on it, i know there's still so
much room for growth.</p>
<p>that friday was a blur. after the announcement, i had no time to
process anything before rushing off to grab a quick lunch between
meetings. it was a whirlwind of emotions—shock, confusion, gratitude,
and everything in between. but amidst the chaos, my amazing team gave me
a sweet moment to pause. they surprised me with a cake and coffee for my
birthday! 🥺 they're honestly the best, and i felt so touched that they
remembered despite how busy everything was. it was a reminder of how
lucky i am to work with such thoughtful people. 😭</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9089.jpeg" class="" title="happy me ☺️">
<p>of course, there was no time to rest. meetings filled up the rest of
the day. but shoutout to my colleague, <strong>junjie</strong>, who
helped me sort out logistics like drafting my business travel letter. he
made my life so much easier, and i'm super grateful for his
kindness.</p>
<hr />
<p>now, about the trip—Beijing was incredible! i finally got to visit
ByteDance's headquarters at 大钟侍 and another office at 融中心. the
16-day business trip was a whirlwind of productivity and new
experiences. my primary objective was to oversee the UAT process and
ensure a successful project delivery. while the workload was intense,
meeting colleagues and stakeholders in person brought a refreshing human
connection that had been missing during months of remote collaboration.
being on-site allowed me to dive deeper into project challenges,
brainstorm solutions face-to-face, and even build stronger rapport with
the team. honestly, it was more than just a work trip—it felt like an
opportunity to grow both professionally and personally.</p>
<p><strong>融中心</strong>:</p>

</video>
<p><strong>curious about what my ByteDance life looks like, especially
during my time in the Beijing offices?</strong></p>
<p>i've captured some highlights and behind-the-scenes moments from my
journey in a special Instagram highlight titled <strong>ByteDance
2</strong> &amp; <strong>ByteDance 2.1</strong>. feel free to check it
out <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdGFncmFtLmNvbS9lbmtyMS8=">here<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span>—you might just
catch a glimpse of my day-to-day adventures, the breathtaking office
views, and the vibrant city life! 😊</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/ig-stories.png" class="">
<hr />
<p>the weekends in Beijing were magical. i went on solo adventures,
ticking off places i'd always wanted to visit. walking through the
historical 胡同s, soaking in the vibe of the city—it felt like stepping
into a movie. 🥺</p>
<p>one of my first stops was 天坛公园. i was in awe of the ancient
chinese architecture—it's just so majestic and grand. every detail of
the buildings felt like a glimpse into the past, and i couldn't help but
admire how much history they carry.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9699.jpeg" class="" title="祈谷坛祈年殿">
<p>then, there was the 故宫—absolutely speechless. i mean, this was once
the emperor's home... the sheer size of it left me in disbelief. i found
myself wandering through the halls, just imagining what life must have
been like back then.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9818.jpeg" class="" title="参观故宫">
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9862.jpeg" class="" title="藻井">
<p>another highlight was finally trying 四季民福. i've seen it all over
小红书, and i can confirm—it totally lives up to the hype. the food was
amazing, and it was such a treat to tick it off my list.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_9913.jpeg" class="" title="北京烤鸭">
<p>i also spent some time at 颐和园 and 圆明园, two parks that couldn't
be more different but both so special in their own way. 颐和园 was so
peaceful and relaxing, a perfect place to just slow down and take a
breath. meanwhile, the ruins at 圆明园 felt like a quiet reminder of
history, bittersweet yet humbling to see in person.</p>

<p>南锣鼓巷 was another favourite. i caught the sunset here, and let me
tell you, it was breathtaking. Beijing's winter sunsets hit
differently—so early, around 4pm, but the glow it left in the sky was
unforgettable. 🌅</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0225.jpeg" class="" title="在南锣鼓巷街上看日落">
<p>and, of course, i couldn't miss 什刹海, strolling by the lakes,
surrounded by locals and tourists alike. it had such a vibrant energy,
yet it felt calming at the same time.</p>
<img data-src="/journal-week-19/IMG_0262.jpeg" class="" title="什刹海">
<p>these moments brought me so much joy. every place i visited left an
impression, and i know i'll carry these memories with me forever.
Beijing really has a charm that's hard to put into words—it's a mix of
history, culture, and just pure magic. 🥺🫶🏻</p>
<hr />
<p>but as december went on, it wasn't all smooth sailing. just a week
after the initial announcement, my leader shared that the decision had
been cancelled. i hadn't even fully processed the first news when the
second hit. it was an emotional rollercoaster—relief, confusion, and
gratitude all at once. but i reminded myself: <strong>What lies behind
us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within
us.</strong> life is unpredictable, and sometimes all you can do is
adapt and move forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>as the year-end approached, i took some much-needed leaves. i
originally planned a trip to phuket in mid-december, but with the
business travel and the critical project release, i had to cancel it.
instead, i used the time to rest, recharge, and reflect. honestly, it
turned out to be a blessing in disguise—having that "me time" was
exactly what i needed.</p>
<p>before closing the year, my crew, Obelisk, and i worked on a
countdown beatbox performance for the new year's eve celebration. it was
such a fun project, and i'm so excited to see how it turns out on the
31st! 🎉</p>
<p>thank you for being part of my journey this year. ❤️</p>
<p>this isn't a full reflection of 2024—i'll save that for my next blog.
but for now, here's to closing the year on a hopeful note.</p>
<p>bring it on, 2025! 🎯</p>

<p>i lost my voice the very day i planned to record the voices beatbox
wildcard. it was like universe was playing a cruel joke on me.</p>
<p>honestly, my routine wasn't 100% ready, but losing my voice made
everything feel worse... 😔 i still don't know what caused it, but it
was the first time in my life that i almost completely lost my
voice.</p>
<p>so, instead of giving up, i threw together a freestyle beat in the
office-a routine i literally came up with in like an hour... i recorded
it, posted it, and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>unfortunately, my impromptu routine didn't pass the wildcard
selection. and yeah, i was so mad at myself. 😤 firstly, i could've
prepared and recorded earlier instead of leaving it until the last
minute; secondly, i knew deep down that i didn't put in the effort i
should've. i'm really disappointed in myself, but i also know this is a
lesson to carry forward. 🥺😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>this week, i fully immersed myself in Atomic Habits by James Clear.
as i delved into it, i realised just how much the ideas resonate with
me. some of the principles, like focusing on small changes, are things
i've unconsciously applied in my life. but this book made me aware of
how i can refine and strengthen those actions to create a more effective
"system" for myself. it's genuinely inspiring and i can already feel it
reshaping my mindset.</p>
<p>here are some key highlights from Chapter 1 that struck a chord with
me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable—sometimes it
isn't even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in
the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is
astounding. Here's how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent
better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by
the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day
for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small
win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.”</p></li>
<li><p>“a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a
very different destination.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your
future self.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous
actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major
change.”</p></li>
<li><p>“habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early
and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of
Disappointment. You expect to make progress in a linear fashion and it's
frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first days,
weeks, and even months. It doesn't feel like you are going anywhere.
It's a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes
are delayed.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time
thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your
systems.”</p></li>
<li><p>“We think we need to change our results, but the results are not
the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause
those results.”</p></li>
<li><p>“A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall
in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait
to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime
your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different
forms, not just the one you first envision.”</p></li>
<li><p>“The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single
accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process
that will determine your progress.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<ul>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1
percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</li>
<li>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against
you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li>
<li>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a
critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding
process are delayed. You need to be patient.</li>
<li>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system.
Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are
the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus
on your system instead.</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of
your systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Excerpt From Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results James
Clear - This material may be protected by copyright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it's really all about the systems—this line hit me the hardest: you
do not rise to the level of your goals. you fall to the level of your
systems. looking at my own life, i realise how much my systems need
improvement, and i feel motivated to start making these 1% changes, even
if they seem small right now.</p>

<p>i went on a trip to China for the first time! omg, i don't know where
to start... it was amazing. honestly, i don't think i can put in into
words, ok, so i'll let the pictures do the talking this time. pictures
speak a thousand words, right? 🥹</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i will just attach some of my favourite pictures later~</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on a less cheerful note, i came back with a really really bad sore
throat back that i completely lost my voice halfway through the day at
work. 😭 thank god for the clinic right next to our office that's
covered by insurance-it was so convenient. i literally just gave em my
name, talked to the doc, grabbed my meds and left.</p>
<p>the doc gave me 2 days of mc, but i still went to work the next day.
idk, maybe i was just feeling guilty about taking a day off, but
honestly, my body was sreaming at me to rest. so the day after, i
finally listened. ended up sleeping for 11 hours straight... and omg,
that was the rest i needed! felt so much better afterwards! FULL
RECHARGED! 🔋</p>
<p>but my voice still... and my beatbox competition is approaching
😭</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>AND i finally started reading <strong>Atomic Habits: An Easy &amp;
Proven Way to Build Good Habits &amp; Break Bad Ones by James
Clear</strong>! it's been on my reading list for ages, and i am so
excited to dive into it. just flipping through the first few pages has
already given me a glimpse of how impactful this book could be for
making lasting changes. i can't wait to apply these principles to my
daily life!</p>

<p>this week was intense... a full 7/7 work grind 😔 by friday nightm i
was so wiped out that i just passed out like that and slept for more
than 9 hours straight! woke up and barely had time to catch my breath
before rushing off to work again.</p>
<p>even though it was hectic, i found a bit of thrill in the unknown
challenges and a sense of satisfaction in pushing through. 🎯💪🏼🔥</p>
<p>AND guess what! F26 canteen is gonna reopen next week! OMG finally!
😭🤞🏼</p>
<p>for my beatboxing practice, with 25 days until the comp and 14 days
left to finish my wildcard, i'm giving it my all. i'm trusting the
process, feeling like i'm hitting a low right before the climb. it's
that moment when u're going down the hill, but i'm so ready to rise any
time! 🔥</p>
<p>watch me.</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>i have been revisiting the book <em>Never Split the Difference</em>
by Christopher Voss, a book that's almost become a life strategy guide
for me. i know relying heavily on one book isn't ideal, but i find
myself <strong>taking the parts that resonate, filtering what feels
right, and testing out those ideas in real life</strong>. some of the
techniques? they actually work wonders in human interactions—it's
fascinating.</p>
<p>rereading has been a refreshing way to catch details i might have
missed the first time. it's funny how information can just slip through
ur mind without u even noticing, so a good review always feels
worthwhile. 📝</p>

<p>this week, i felt super productive at work, managing to wrap up most
of my tasks right on time or even ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>each day had a familiar rhythm—get up, commute with a good book,
work, hit the gym, beatbox practice, unwind with some me-time, then
sleep. it may have been routine, but there's a sense of calm in the
consistency.</p>
<p>i also decided to head back to malaysia to spend time with my family.
my mum recently hurt her lower back, and i could feel the urge to be
close, to share some quality time and be there for her. this time with
family, no matter how brief, always feels grounding. ❤️</p>
<p>another bright spot was reconnecting with my friends from secondary
school. these are people who have been part of my journey for years, and
catching up with them brought back so many good memories. seeing them
doing so well made me genuinely happy, and i'm just grateful to have
these friendships still going strong.</p>
<p>普普通通 平平淡淡的一周</p>

<p>It is impossible to seamlessly blend into a team as a jigsaw piece
unless you comprehend the unique shape of each of your team members. Sir
Alex Ferguson's acumen in this regard was legendary, as attested to by
his former players and staff, and even rival managers. He possessed an
encyclopedic knowledge of everything from the hobbies of his players'
wives to the names of their pets, and as Rio Ferdinand told me, even
their grandfathers' preferred brand of whisky. More significantly, he
knew that every member of his team was propelled by vastly different
motivators. While one player may have thrived under Ferguson's infamous
‘hairdryer' treatment (where he would shout angrily at them in the
dressing room or on the training ground), another may have required a
more compassionate approach, and still another may have been motivated
by a more hands-off approach. This is why Ferguson didn't have to be the
tactical mastermind that many assume he must have been, but rather an
emotional savant. When you're in the business of motivating people,
<strong>emotional management is everything.</strong></p>

<p>Great leaders are fluid, flexible, and full of fluctuation. They are
whatever shape they need to be, to complete your motivation.</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week, my priorities were on: work, gym and prepping myself for
the beatbox competition i'm planning to participate. to top it off...
6th december is my birthday too! UGH</p>
<p>it's been over 3 years since i last battled, and i can't even begin
to explain how much i miss it—the rush of adrenaline when you're on
stage, the energy from the crowd, and the vibe from all the other
beatboxers. it's not just the competition; it's the whole experience
that i miss so much.</p>
<p>i've been putting in a lot of effort lately, but, to be honest, it
still feels like i could do more... but, balancing everything—work, gym,
and beatboxing—is tough. after a long day at work, it's straight to the
gym, and only after that do i get the time to practise beatboxing. but i
know it's all about mental. the grind never stops, and i have to push
through it.</p>
<p>my biggest challenge right now is breaking out of my usual beats and
trying to create something new. it's been about 20 days of trying, and
i'm still struggling to come up with fresh routines. it's frustrating,
but i know this is the part of the process where many people give up.
this feeling of being stuck—that's the moment when you're on the verge
of a breakthrough. if i can just push past this, i know success is just
around the corner.</p>
<p>i got this. 🙌</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The sole reason of why people procrastinate is because they're
trying to avoid some form of ‘psyhological discomfort' in their life.
The bigger the task and the less competent we feel about accomplishing
it, the greater the procrastination."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this quote really struck me. i could feel it resonate in my daily
life, especially when it comes to things like hitting the snooze button
in the morning or mindlessly scrolling through 抖音 and instagram reels.
it's like i'm delaying that sense of discomfort, avoiding the challenge
ahead, even though i know it's not helping me in the long run.</p>
<p>i know i am not alone in this, and that gives me a bit of comfort.
but i also know this is a process, one that takes time and
self-awareness. i'm working on it—slowly, but surely. recognising this
psychological discomfort as the root of procrastination is already a
step forward for me. the next step is taking action, even when i don't
feel ready, and learning to push through that initial resistance. it's a
journey of self-discipline and growth.</p>
<p>i'm not perfect—there are still days when i fall into old habits, but
understanding why i procrastinate has shifted my mindset. i've come to
realise that it's not about eliminating procrastination overnight, but
about <strong>improving little by little</strong>, showing up even on
the hard days, and building momentum. one small victory at a time.
🌱</p>
<p>at the end of the day, <strong>progress over perfection</strong> is
what really matters. so, while i might still have moments of distraction
or hesitation, i'm committed to pushing through and becoming the best
version of myself, one day at a time.</p>

<p>i completely forgot to mention something from the previous week—it
slipped my mind while writing! 💀 i guess the gym story took the
spotlight for me.</p>
<p>i had the honour of being a judge at the <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAI7HN8IOxN/">Ignition Beatbox Academy
Event</a> by the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly81NTViZWF0Ym94c2luZ2Fwb3JlLmNvbS8=">555 Beatbox
Initiative<i class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></i></span> on 12th October 2024. the judging panel included
Clarkceds, Varen, and myself, and it was such a privilege to be a part
of it. we judged the level 2 students' showcases and the level 3 battle.
watching them perform was a proud moment. i still remember seeing some
of these students on their first day, and now, to witness how far
they've come—it's honestly incredible.</p>
<p>okay, let's talk about this week!</p>
<p>this week was pretty chill overall. i had a few gym sessions with
Inovity, and honestly, having someone push you to failure just hits
different! 🔥</p>
<p>seeing my coworkers travelling for business trips did make me feel a
little envious—i'd love to go on one soon. they've been travelling so
often, and i'm really happy for them! i'm just waiting for my chance and
feeling excited for whenever that happens, or maybe i will have to fight
for it? idk, it is a mix of feelings 🥹🤞🏼 but at the end of the day, i
know that everyone has their own timing. i will keep pushing myself and
doing my best, knowing that my opportunity will come when it is meant
to. turning that envy into motivation is what keeps me going—i have
learned to celebrate others while still working towards my own goals.
🫶🏻</p>
<p>on the work front, i've been feeling more motivated and super
productive. i made it a point to be proactive, asking more questions
(not the dumb kind tho 😂). i always try things myself first before
seeking help.</p>
<p>overall, this week was a productive one!</p>
<p>下周继续加油 竞辉！💪🏼</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week, something really struck me during one of my workout
sessions with toby. i had been casually "coaching" him, showing him my
workout style and sharing techniques i've picked up over the years. but
what came next hit me like a life metaphor that i didn't see coming.</p>
<p><strong>"Work is like working out"</strong>, toby said.</p>
<p>you can start off pushing hard—whether it's at work or in the gym.
sometimes, you overdo it, like putting in long hours at work without the
right strategy, or hitting the gym with bad form. the funny thing is, if
no one points out that you're doing it wrong, you might not even realise
it. that's where a personal trainer (PT) in the gym—or a mentor at
work—comes in. they're there to guide you, correct your form, and show
you the correct way, the better way, refine your technique, and show you
a more effective path—one that not only helps you reach your goals but
also gets you there faster and with greater precision. but here's the
key difference: in work, people aren't going to proactively correct you,
you have to be <strong>proactive</strong> yourself. ask the right
questions, observe, listen, learn, and most importantly, <strong>be
consistent</strong>. success comes down to consistently showing up and
putting in the work, whether it's in the gym or in life.</p>
<p><strong>ByteDance and the Gym</strong></p>
<p>toby pointed out something else that really hit home for me. he said
working at ByteDance is a lot like working out. there's a "7-2-1"
approach there, where you dive into the deep end (the "7") without first
mastering the basics (the "1"). it reminded me of when i first started
gymming two years ago. i was clueless about proper form or technique,
yet i still managed to get into shape by watching a few YouTube
tutorials. but looking back, i wonder—<strong>was all the time i spent
really worth it?</strong> would i have gotten there faster if i had
invested in a PT early on? work is the same. you can't expect people to
hold your hand. you have to seek out mentors, guidance, and constantly
refine your "form." 💪</p>
<p><strong>Life Lessons from the Gym</strong></p>
<p>then toby dropped a truth bomb: <em>"you've succeeded in the gym,
going from a skinny guy to a 'buff load,' so why not apply the same
concept to life?"</em> 💡</p>
<p>that hit me hard. the way i push myself to the failure in the gym,
the way i visualise each exercise to make sure it works—those same
principles can be applied to life. and toby made me realise that i've
actually been influencing others, showing them how to push themselves
beyond their limits. now, it's my turn to find someone who can
<strong>influence me</strong> and take me to the next level, just like i
helped toby.</p>
<p>we also talked about how important it is to be specific in
communication. vague feedback like "this is good" or "i think it's
working" won't help anyone grow. you need to explain <em>why</em>
something is good, and avoid phrases like "i feel like..." that leave
things too open-ended. clarity and precision are what help people
improve.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting Niq, the PT</strong></p>
<p>later in the week, we met niq, a PT at Fitness First, and he was just
different. there was no ego, no attitude—just genuine passion for
working out. he was sharing machines with us and offering small tips,
like we were all gym buddies. at first, i didn't even know he was a PT.
but when he dropped a tip on how to engage our triceps better during
pushdowns, it clicked for me. it was one of those moments where you
think you know something, but you're not applying it properly. it made
me realise how important these small adjustments are. 💪</p>
<p>what really set niq apart from other PTs i've met was how freely and
passionately he shared his knowledge, expecting nothing in return. it
reminded me of how i approach things—i genuinely love helping people,
without expecting anything back. seeing that same energy in niq made me
realise that's the vibe i want to continue spreading in my life too.</p>
<p><strong>Reflections</strong></p>
<p>this week really opened my eyes to how the lessons we learn in one
area—whether it's the gym, work, or relationships—can apply to others.
consistency, communication, and the willingness to learn are the keys to
success, no matter what you're striving for. just like in the gym, in
life, you need the right form, the right guidance, and the right mindset
to reach your goals.</p>
<p><strong>life and work are like a gym session—it's all about finding
the right balance, asking the right questions, and putting in the effort
every day, even when it's tough.</strong> 🧠</p>

<p>on the 2nd of october, my siblings and i jumped on a call with my
mom, right at midnight sg time, to wish her a happy birthday! it was
special because this year, we were all in different countries, but we
still made the time to connect, no matter the distance. we promised to
celebrate properly with dinner when my sis gets back on saturday, can't
wait! ❤️</p>
<p>toby invited me for a 3-day free trial session at Fitness First. he
mentioned our gym sessions were even more valuable than his private ones
🥺.</p>
<p>AND daidai whipped up 刀削面 for me at his place, it was so good-who
knew instant noodles could taste that scrumptious!? have you ever had
instant noodles so good you wouldn't believe they came from a packet?!
that's what he cooked up for me! the view from his condo and the comfort
of those noodles-it was all just what i needed. OH, and let me not
forget—he has the cutest cat! 😭</p>
<p>unfortunately, our plan to celebrate my mom's birthday got delayed
because of my sis' flight being rescheduled 😔. but i am really looking
forward to when she is back and we can have that family moment
together.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>"Failure tempts people to lose focus as motivation and
belief decrease, but success tempts people to lose focus even more, as
opportunities, offers, and capabilities increase."</strong> this made me
think—sometimes, when things are going well, it's easier to get
distracted by new offers and ideas, and you lose sight of the core goal.
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Failure and Loss of Focus</strong>: when people experience
failure, their motivation and self-belief often diminish. this leads to
a loss of focus because their confidence in achieving their goals has
been shaken. in other words, <strong>failure makes it harder to stay on
track due to the discouragement it creates.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Success and Loss of Focus</strong>: the surprising insight
here is that success can be an even bigger challenge to focus. When
people experience success, it can open up many new opportunities,
offers, and capabilities. while this sounds like a positive situation,
it can also lead to a dilution of focus. success brings distractions in
the form of new projects, side ventures, or alternative paths.
<strong>the challenge here is to maintain the same level of discipline
and singular focus</strong> that helped achieve success in the first
place.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>while failure demotivates, success overwhelms with possibilities,
both of which can cause a loss of focus. the key takeaway is the
<strong>importance of staying focused</strong> no matter the external
circumstances—whether in the face of failure or success.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><strong>"You can predict someone's success in any area of their
life by observing how willing and capable they are at dealing with
uncomfortable conversations. Your personal progression is trapped behind
an uncomfortable conversation."</strong> it's a reminder for me that the
path to growth often comes through discomfort, especially when it comes
to communication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>"Embracing this duality of thought – balancing positivity
with negativity – equips us with the wisdom, fortitude and foresight to
forge a more successful path forward."</strong></p></li>

          <h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2>
<p>this week, i went back to malaysia to celebrate 79th birthday
(华人生日) of my grandpa (爷爷) 👴🏽. it was such a priceless moment
seeing him so happy that night 🥺❤️. time really does fly—it feels like
just yesterday he was still the strong, sharp grandpa, but now, he's
aged. seeing him now, young at heart but older in body, is both
heartwarming and heartbreaking. it reminds me <strong>how fragile time
is, how every moment we spend together is precious.</strong> seeing my
grandparents, my parents, my nieces, everyone age... it's hard to
accept... and i don't want to face that reality, but, seeing how well
they are all doing, seeing the love we share, somehow makes it easier.
it's like a wave of bittersweet emotions all at once, it's complex.</p>
<p>i've been thinking a lot about time lately, how quickly it passes,
and how i spent it. i want to be more present, to focus on what really
matters—family, love, connection. i've started small, hiding most of my
social media apps, and honestly, it's helping. it's a little step, but
it feels like the right one. <strong>i don't want to look back and
realise i've missed out on the important things because i was too busy
staring at a screen.</strong> i want to really know my family,
understand them better, and love them even more. ❤️</p>
<p>time, please don't fly so fast... 🥺🥲😭 let me soak in these moments
just a little longer.</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights-from-the-diary-of-a-ceo">📝 Reading Insights
from <strong>The Diary of a CEO</strong>:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Be a Plan-A thinker</strong>: while i don't entirely agree
with this mindset, it does make sense in some situations. being a Plan-A
thinker forces you to focus on your goal with no distractions—there's no
backup plan to fall back on. like the book says, "Having a backup plan,
or even considering one, has been shown to potentially hinder your
performance by making you less driven to hit your primary goal." without
plan B, u have no choice but to work harder.</li>
<li><strong>Perseverance &amp; consistency</strong>: <strong>"Pain in
every walk of life is unavoidable, but the pain that we create by trying
to avoid pain is avoidable."</strong> this really resonated with me.
it's a reminder that trying to avoid discomfort or pain often creates
more problems than facing it head-on.</li>
<li><strong>Pressure is a Privilege</strong>: stress and pressure aren't
the same thing. while pressure can lead to stress, it can also be a
driving force for growth when handled well. <strong>"Comfortable and
Easy are short-term friends but long-term enemies. If you're looking for
growth, choose the challenge."</strong> choosing challenges over comfort
is what leads to real growth.</li>

<p>this past week felt pretty normal, but not in a bad way. it was
mid-autumn festival, and i had a quick gathering with my relatives. the
weather, though, wasn't having it—it rained so heavily, felt like i
could see things flying around! despite that, it was a good time with
the family.</p>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>one little lesson that i relearned this week is how <strong>"If you
don't care about tiny details you'll produce bad work because good work
is the culmination of hundreds of tiny details. The world's most
successful people sweat the small stuff"</strong>. this really hit home
for me, especially when i think about beatboxing—something i know well.
i've realised that the key to becoming great in any area, especially in
beatboxing, is focusing on the smallest details. the moments when i step
back and refine those tiny things are what push my skills to the next
level.</p>

          <h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<p>this week felt like a calm wave—steady and uneventful, but beneath
the surface, there were hidden wins. i had a briefing meeting about a
project that recently went live. hearing from the leaders that i managed
to impress one of the toughest stakeholders? that hit me. hearing "you
must've done a good job" felt like the validation i didn't even realise
i needed. it's that kind of praise that fuels your spirit, knowing all
the hard work really counts. 🥺</p>
<h2 id="reading-insights">📝 Reading Insights</h2>
<p>on the reading front, i'm still deep into <strong>The Diary of a
CEO</strong>, and i stumbled upon a few ideas that truly resonated with
me this week:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>"If you change the frame, you change your
message"</strong>—this is communication at its finest. i've come to see
how true this is. it's not just about having the best ideas, but HOW you
deliver them. the way you frame an idea can transform how it's
received—this is something i see in my day-to-day work. even the most
brilliant idea can fall flat if it's not presented in the right context.
framing is an art that can make all the difference between confusion and
clarity, and it's been a game-changer for me in how i communicate at
work. it doesn't matter how brilliant or innovative you are, if you
can't frame your ideas right, they will never land with the
audience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>"The easiest way to do big things is by focusing on the
small things"</strong>—this resonates so deeply with me because it
mirrors my philosophy on growth. it's easy to overlook the small
details, but it's in those small steps that the big leaps happen. for
me, there's no shortcut to success. focusing on the little things every
day, bit by bit, is what eventually leads to achieving the big goals.
and when you trust the process, even the most impossible things start to
feel within reach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>"When a hobby becomes a job, the motivation
drops."</strong>-while beatboxing isn't my career, i started to feel
this shift when my team Obelisk began prepping for paid performances.
the fun we used to have during our jam sessions faded a little once we
had to focus on delivering for an audience. it felt like the carefree
creativity was replaced by structured rehearsals and deadlines, making
it feel like a job. but despite this, i am pushing to keep the fun
alive. it's a reminder that even when passions evolve, <strong>it's
important to hold on to the spark that started it all.</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Work Achievement:</strong> i finally got the project i've
been working on published online! this was a big milestone for me.
looking back, i'm proud of how i managed the stress, handled all the
edge cases, and adapted to sudden changes. when i first got this
project, it felt impossible. but it reminded me of how many "impossible"
projects i've overcome before. honestly, i'm so proud of myself for
pushing through it all. 🥺</li>
<li><strong>Family Time:</strong> this week, we said goodbye to my
brother, busy pang. i spent a lot of time with my family, which really
made me reflect on how fast time flies. we're all adults now—my brother
is finishing his studies next year, and soon, we'll all be working
adults. it feels surreal.</li>
<li><strong>Beatboxing:</strong> i've had so many creative ideas this
week for beatboxing. i started my beatbox sessions in the toilet again!
this time, i'm recording myself to capture those moments of inspiration.
i already have a few good ones that will help me get closer to my
beatboxing goals, and i couldn't be more excited!</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Exploring New Experiences:</strong> this week was filled
with firsts—tried Arabica coffee for the first time, went to a
candlelight concert, and spent quality time with my brother and his gf.
and... it's already been 9 months at ByteDance, but it feels more than a
year, that's strange, time is quick and slow. time flies and drags at
the same time, but it also gives me a moment to reflect on how much i've
grown.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>this week, i really resonated with a couple of concepts from
<strong>The Diary of a CEO</strong>. one of them is the idea of
<strong>leaning into cognitive dissonance</strong>—when you experience
that uncomfortable feeling of encountering something that doesn't align
with what you know, instead of retreating, it's important to lean in and
explore it. this reminded me of how i've grown in my career,
particularly at ByteDance. early on, i encountered a lot of situations
where i felt out of my depth, but <strong>pushing through those moments
of discomfort is where the most growth happened</strong>. for
instance,</p>
<p>when i first started taking over a project that required a deep
understanding of the business logic, it was unfamiliar and daunting at
first. it was absolutely confusing and challenging, but by immersing
myself in it, i not only learnt how that part of the business functions
but also developed a new approach to problem-solving.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elixir Exploration:</strong> this week, i dived back into
some elixir topics and even tried deploying my app on fly.io. i'm really
seeing the potential in elixir and its famous phoenix framework. i'm
excited to start a side project with it and relearn everything i know
about elixir!</li>
<li><strong>Reading:</strong> i've been reading <em>The Diary of a
CEO</em> by Steven Bartlett. one quote that really resonated with me is:
"Do the thing you fear, and keep on doing it. that is the quickest and
surest way ever yet discovered to conquer fear." it's been on my mind
all week and has inspired me to push through my own fears.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>this week reminded me of the importance of revisiting foundational
knowledge. whether it's with elixir or in life, going back to the basics
can open up new perspectives and reignite your passion. continuous
learning and embracing the journey are key to growth.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Work:</strong> full productivity at work, got a lot of todos
done! felt really productive and even managed to get off work earlier.
doing so much better compared to my last quarter where i'd be OT-ing
till 4 am.</li>
<li><strong>Gym:</strong> back to my usual gym routine (PPL), only
resting a day now! getting back into my old routine feels so good!</li>
<li><strong>Personal Priorities:</strong> finally got some time for
personal priorities and even squeezed in some learning!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>i relearned how important it is to make notes and write down your
todos. it's like having a second brain, which reminded me of the book
"Building a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte. this book really changed my
life. it was recommended by my previous leader, Lio!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Family Time:</strong> my brother came back from Spain
this week, and it was both great and challenging to reconnect. he's
evolved in many ways—he's grown, learnt, and become a better version of
himself. however, we also noticed a bit of arrogance and ego creeping
in, which made our interactions a bit tense. we wanted to help him see
some of these changes, but our approach came off more like an attack
than a helpful conversation. It reminded me that even with good
intentions, the way you frame your words really matters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication Insight:</strong> this week, i really
learnt the importance of how you frame what you say. It's not just about
having good intentions or the right message—it's about delivering that
message in a way that others can easily digest and understand. if you
frame things poorly, you might convey the wrong meaning, leading to
confusion or even conflict. This idea resonated with me deeply,
especially in the context of my work where communication and structuring
information are crucial, just like how a well-structured JSON makes life
easier for the backend developers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>this week i was reminded that communication isn't just about what you
say but how you say it. when you frame your thoughts well, you make it
easier for others to understand and engage with your ideas. this is true
in personal conversations, like the ones i had with my brother, and it's
also true in professional settings. just as a well-structured data
object streamlines coding; clear and thoughtful communication smooths
the path in life. it's not about giving vague, surface-level
information, but about sharing your thoughts in a way that makes sense
and is easy to digest for others.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Personal update</strong>: this week was a busy week for me
to migrate to my new place. renting a room in singapore is tough. i feel
like a hermit crab... i skipped quite a few gym sessions because i had
to clean up and unpack stuff. from the lease that we just ended, my
sister and i did not get the full deposit back, which was totally
ridiculous. we were speechless but just let it go. (might update more on
this next time?)</li>
<li><strong>Beatboxing</strong>: oh dear, i had a bad flu this week :(
didn't beat as much, but i've been progressing on my throat bass and
vibration throat bass. i'm getting more and more comfortable with
it!</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: i had my first ByteDance All-Hands in person!
it was totally an eye-opening experience to hear the heads of each
department talk about the updates of last quarter, their visions for the
departments, products, and company.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>this week i re-learnt that to have a solid and great product, you
need to be the user. you need to be in the user's shoes to actually see
how good or bad your product is. by doing this, you can get first-hand
feedback and better understand your product and the overall experience,
said Rubo Liang. i totally agree with this point. i learnt this key
concept from Lio when i was working at Pixium Digital. he was my leader
and the CTO of the company. i used to build something inhuman when i was
in charge of my first few projects, even though i had a UX/UI
background. that's strange, isn't it? and yes, i still made those
mistakes. but after listening to him, i tried to use my product and
realised, wow, he was totally right. this is a solid point and something
to always remember as a developer, project manager, or leader.</p>

          <p>i'm starting a new adventure: journalling! i want to jot down the
interesting things i learn and experience every week. hopefully, this
will become a habit, and maybe i'll even start doing it daily.</p>
<p>why am i doing this? honestly, i'm not sure. but i feel like sharing
my weekly and daily discoveries with everyone could be fun and
insightful. let's see where this journey takes us!</p>
<h2 id="highlights-of-the-week">✨ Highlights of the Week</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beatboxing</strong>: got back into beatboxing. it felt so
good to practise again.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Time</strong>: caught up with an old friend and
spent some cherished moments with family.</li>
<li><strong>Work</strong>: Productive week, amazing session and great
ideas are brewing!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="little-lesson">Little Lesson</h2>
<p>this week i learnt from my sister that when you want to convince
someone on a specific topic, don't straight up jump into the concept you
think they'll agree on. first, ask if they're thinking in that
direction. so, thinking out loud is good but always clarify first.</p>
